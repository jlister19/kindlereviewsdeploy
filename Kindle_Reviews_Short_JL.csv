However, I found the book rather boring and lackluster when comparing the two. It seemed to begin somewhere in the middle of an undefined plot (plot??) and worked it's way to the end, which I must admit was surprising. Usually the book is better than the movie, but in this case the reverse is true. If you've seen the movie, don't expect to find any similarity between the two. I really found the book to be a little confusing and boring. The only thing I recognized was the giant robot (named Gnut instead of Gort). I was disappointed.",Not near as good as the movie,2,6/26/2016

That's helpful for those who are forgetful, but annoying to those who remember. It could have been half its length if carefully edited. Its extensive list of sources belies the simplicity of the prose, however, so while it is simple and easy to understand, apparently it is backed up with research. I wish that research were integrated into the book to enhance its credibility and to show where studies were being cited. If you're completely new to the world of glycemic load, this is a good start. If you are better informed, skip this book.

3,2,A1P00M7SDR84JY,B000JMKQKS,"When I found how much I gained form the Jason Fung information I decided that I should do some studying on other diet related theories that I had no knowledge of.  And as usual I went by the customer feedback on the amazon pages to quickly find the most valuable books to read on things like the paleo diet and the glycemic index stuff.
When I put in the search terms 'glyceimc index'  for Amazon books I was a bit dismayed to have a page come up with a dozen or so paperbacks that had names and covers appearing to all be in a series done identically. When I clicked on titles, and went right to the customer reviews, it seemed that all the customers had the same feeling about the books, as if they were nearly identical.  A few people thought what they got was all they would ever need to know, and these must have been people who did not have much information about the subject.
Others like me, who left reviews, had information on the subject and wanted something more in depth. These comments were that the lists with glycemic loads of various food were all about packaged foods that they had stopped eating long ago, as I had, and not whole foods. I also noticed that the lists of foods all seemed to be identical from some government source.
Comments by people who felt a book lacked certain things led me along to other titles they said were better. So in time I did get to a book that had a bit more than the other did, 'Glycemic Load Diet' by Robb Thompson.
Any book would give the basics, and the number of pages was also almost identical.  And the cover comments of how wonderful the book was, seemed to all be by authors of almost identical books. And each book seemed to have the last third be recipes.  Excuse me, but I have spices and ingredients thee authors never even heard of and cook healthy and very tasty meals  people are crazy for and I don't need a list of a dozen ingredients to measure and out in separate containers to mix in a special sequence. I grab stuff from where and there and put it all in one bowl, and if they had given me more glycemic numbers for real food it would have been a bit nicer for the diet thing, but otherwise still great.
And I have news for all these authors ALMOST NO ONE BUT ME AND A FEW OF THE CUSTOMER REVIEWERS ACTUALLY COOKS WITH REAL FOOD ANYMORE.  Do they really think the fast food junkies in enough dietary trouble to buy their books is going to get all that stuff and measure it and make those time consuming dishes?  I don't think so.
And some of the numbers I question because, for example I gave up 99% of wheat in my diet years ago. And years ago I found that pastas made from things that were not grains, were not exactly like wheat pastas, but were pretty good. And I also noticed that they did not make my blood sugar reading so drastic as anything wheat would do. I realized that the pasta from beans and roots and  pumpkin were what the glycemic index was all about. Only the lists showed they had the name number as wheat pasta. So it sort of missed what we were hoping to learn from the lists.
I did get a number of important points out if the book. Fotr example, all the years of carb counting I read books that hinted alcohol did not have carbs as such, but anyone with sense would avoid it if all possible.  I believed that authors were just raining on the parade instead of saying 'GOOD NEWS, GET AS DRUNK AS YOU LIKE ON THIS DIET!!' the glycemic index I assume is the same in every book showed the same  < 'less than' sign it did for the meat and other protein foods as having no carbs to speak of . the text dais that alchhol could make you want to eat more, but that was all.  So let me give you the good news, you can get as drunk as you like on the diet!!  Now I don't drink often so when I do a very small amount works real good.  And given some very disturbing things happening at the time (what the I Ching calls 'misfortune from without', not something I caused to happen) and I was finding one a day of those little bud-a rama fake 8% margueritas for over a week  and binge watching historical costume Korean soap operas was making my life a lot less stressful.
I did get a few things out of this book, but it does not rise far above the rest of the assembly line to serve a new audience. If there is an author out there who has some real in depth information and insight on glycemic index stuff, I, and at least several dozen others reviewing similar books did not find that person.
While the glycemic diet is just another Atkin's  spin off, there are some things we did not know before that  that make it a bit easier to stay on, such as eating a bit of sweet at the end of the meal.  This I had already found helped to get my blood sugar to go down more after a meal.  I wish there had been more detail about that.  And since I did skip some parts perhaps there is.
Right now I am an annoyed person and it is not easy to clear my mind to read books and put other thoughts aside. But then I think most people who are looking for a book of this kind are the same way.  And those of us who had to go total zero carbs for a couple weeks on Atkin's to get purple in the dig stick, may not do so well with the sweet at the end thing.
Back wen we read Atkin's, we got some real info and most of us lost a lot of weight that stayed off for pretty long.  It remains to be seen whether there is any startling results to be happy about from dealing with the glycemic index.",not as much helpful information as i had hoped for,8,10/6/2016

5,5,A2X4AEWNWCA1NX,B000VDUWMC,"Two decades ago a UCLA geography professor named Jared Diamond published Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. Diamond hypothesized that the arc of human history was dramatically shifted by geographic, environmental, biological, and other factors, resulting in the worldwide dominance of the leading industrial powers during the past 500 years. The book won a 1997 Pulitzer Prize and quickly became a New York Times bestseller.

Why is economic development so uneven around the world?

Diamond posed questions fundamental to the experience of the human race. Why did wealth and power [among nations] become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way? [W]hy did human development proceed at such different rates on different continents? [W]hy were Europeans, rather than Africans or Native Americans, the ones to end up with guns, the nastiest germs, and steel? In his award-winning book, Diamond posited a unified synthesisa unified field theory of history. Drawing from his wide-ranging knowledge of medicine, evolutionary biology, physiology, linguistics, and anthropology as well as geography, he surveyed the history of the past 13,000 years and identified plausible answers to the questions he had posed. In the process, he wrote what I consider to be the single most illuminating book on the history of the human race.

Academic critics howled

However, academic critics howled shortly after the publication of Guns, Germs, and Steel:

  They referred to supposed errors in geography and history, which I find largely pointless. For example, geographers complained that Diamond referred to Eurasia as a single continent rather than separately to Asia, North Africa, and Europe. Thats nitpicking, as far as Im concerned. And many of these errors could simply be differences of opinion. Academics are unbearably dogmatic and dismissive of those who reject their pet theories.

  Some accused him of racism, although he rejected racist explanations early, forcefully, and often. That criticism is not only unsupported by Diamonds book, its insulting to the reader.

  The most common and far-reaching complaint was that Diamond had succumbed to the heresy of environmental determinism. Understandably, Diamond grounded his argument in geographic and environmental factorsbut he repeatedly cited numerous other influences as well. Ultimately, of course, everything we humans do, and everything weve done in the millions of years since our ancestors first climbed out of the trees, has been environmentally determined.

  There were complaints that Diamond had overlooked the contrast between temperate and tropical zones (he didnt) and that he had only explained what happened 500 years ago but not subsequently (untrue). It might appear that at least some of Diamonds critics never read the book.

  However, the most aggravating criticism was that he had ignored the motives that led the industrial nations to undertake colonialism and imperialism on a broad scale. Diamond addressed only the means that enabled the colonial powers to dominate, not the reasons why they chose to do so. To my mind, thats no error. He didn't pretend to explain colonialism and imperialism, merely to describe how it had become possible.

Is it possible that most of these academic critics were simply bitter that Diamond hadnt cited their own specialized research?

The roots of academic criticism

Though the critics undoubtedly uncovered a misplaced fact or unwarranted conclusion here and there through the book, the errors were exceedingly minor in the context of Diamonds expansive hypothesis. It should be clear to any dispassionate reader that the academic reaction stemmed, above all, from narrow-mindedness and jealousy. The world of academia today is atomized. Specialties, sub-specialties, and sub-sub-specialties abound. Its not unusual for a scholar to build a career on the study of a single obscure question that, when answered, will be of interest to virtually nobody. Interdisciplinary studies are frowned upon in most academic circles. Generalists are regarded as not serious. And scholars who write popular books, must less bestsellers, can expect a chilly reception from their peers.

A wealth of meaning behind the title

To understand where the academic critics went wrong, its useful to look at what Diamond signified by his title, Guns, Germs, and Steel. Early in his book, he dwells on the confrontation between the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro and the Inca god-king Atahuallpa. The immediate reasons for Pizarros success included military technology based on guns, steel weapons [such as swords and daggers], and horses; infectious diseases endemic in Eurasia; European maritime technology; the centralized political organization of European states; and writing. The title of this book will serve as shorthand for those proximate factors.

Diamonds argument in a nutshell

In a Prologue, Diamond poses the question at the heart of this book. He quotes a friend in what is now Papua New Guinea from a conversation in 1972, when he was studying bird evolution there: Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo [goods] and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?' To answer the question, Diamond begins his story around the year 11,000 BCE, when the last Ice Age was drawing to a close and human beings were beginning to form villages in a few places around the world. Its unclear whether the formation of villages preceded the deliberate cultivation and production of food, or vice versa. However, regardless of the sequence, that shift from hunter-gatherer society to agriculturally based settlements set in motion the course of events that have led to the civilization in which we live.

Diamond argues, convincingly, that the much greater availability of domesticable plants and large animals in Eurasia than in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. Furthermore, he explains that the east-west orientation of Eurasia from the Bering Strait to the Atlantic Ocean made it possible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry to spread quickly to distant lands. By contrast, the north-south orientation of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africaand the presence of barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Panamanian Isthmus, and the deserts of northern Mexico and southwestern United Statesimpeded the spread of these (and, later, other) new technologies to the extremities of those continents. The advent of food production enabled the development of ever-larger settlements. This, in turn, spelled the emergence of labor specialization and eventually the growth of empires as well as the appearance and spread of communicable diseases contracted from domesticated animals. Those differences in historical development eventually led to the guns, germs, and steel that made Eurasian dominance possibleand dictated the huge differences in economic development between what today we call East and West.

Guns, Germs, and Steel is crammed with facts and densely written. It doesnt make for light reading. But if you have any interest in understanding how the world came to be as it is, youll find this book highly rewarding.",The only persuasive explanation for the wealth gap between the West and the rest,177,1/24/2017
6,5,A3SC0J7CHHHHKH,B000VMBYL6,I have lost 22 pounds in 6 weeks by using the recipes in this book and following the guidelines.  Awesome!  I have recommended to everyone I know who is trying to lose some weight.  It works!,Awesome! I have recommended to everyone I know who ...,12,10/16/2016
7,1,A1P00M7SDR84JY,B000VMBYL6,"Having just reviewed diet books that turned out to be little more than fluff,  I got very angry when I expected this book to deliver some real information that would be of value to helping me reverse diabetes, after making a good start on doing it after finding the Jason Fung YouTube videos and book.
The trouble begins on page 5 when we are shown the first of a set of graphs. All the graphs have two lines, one representing glucose and the other insulin. Figure 1.1 sys each unit represents 10 ulU/ml insulin or 75mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.2 the same is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 20mg/dl glucose.  Graph 2.2 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 25mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.3 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 100 mg/dl glucose. There is so little information on the graphs that they are essentially meaningless, even if the same scale had been the same on all of them.
Now on page 16 you are told that you can figure your body mass index on the chart 2.4.  but the chart has only height and weight boxes. Nowhere in the book are you told what to do with the height and weight figures tocompute your body mass.
The back cover says 'charts to determine your insulin resistance and check progress'  implying you will find this information in the book.  But all you get is a statement on page 27 directing you to go to a web site to do an online  'insulin resistance test'.
Having found the easy and dramatically effective information from Jason Fung that got my blood glucose reading down over 100 points in 3 days doing his;mini fasts' of no eating between meals for as little time as 5 or 6 hours, I was surprised to find on page 46 of this book the advise:
'Do eat frequent small meals, at 2-5 hour intervalsgoing long periods of time without eating only encourages more fat storage'
the book has pages with day 1,2 ND 3, Ec with about 10 blank lines to chart progress. You are directed to page 39 for information how to do this. Page 39 shows a representation of a scale with one or two circles on one side and one or two squares on the other, representing 'linking and balancing'  protein and carbs.  If you eat two each, then you have one rectangle of 'foods such as vegetables'  if you have one each you have two rectangles.
While there is a lot of test about eating fats,  the traditional last third of the book giving recipes stresses ingredients such as fat free margarine, cheese, and whipped topping '  and using 'sugar free gelatin (full of wholesome sugar substitute we were warned about earlier, and artificial color and flavor)  while we are told people who eat more dairy have less insulin resistance, but are these people eating dairy altered to remove fat ?
The book claims things such as that eating fat makes you crave more food, that you can not do anything to lose weight around your weight, and that  eating wheat is just fine, and wheat s the same as any other carbs.
I will stop here and address these last few 'facts'. This book suggests a diet very similar to what I ate all my life and got fat on, and could never lose weight until I found Atkin's.  eating more NATURAL  fats, and especially in meat, what we call fat but is actually connective tissue such as the thick skin on pork shoulder,  is what kept me from being hungry most of my life-and I almost never get hungry. It also contributed greatly to my regrowing cartlidge in a 'bone to bone' knee I was as told I could not return to normal by a doctor wanting to put in an artificial knee.
As for waist size, my personal research taught me that taking 2-4 grams of potassium citrate  twice a day ( intended to remove lead or other heavy metals from your system in 6 weeks, you will lose not weight but trim 2 sizes off your waist size in a week.  I gave a lot of friends I  knew at UFO conference the stuff  andevery one who took it  had their pants falling off by the end of the week.
As for exercise, I  also worked construction as a pipefitter for a few years and while eating a diet of protein and natural rbs similar to their 'pared' amounts touted in this book and I never lost an ounce.  In fact I never lost any weight in my life except on the Atkin's diet by first cutting back to zero carbs for a couple weeks, and adding very few back if I wanted to keep it off.
And at a time when most researchers are finding wheat is a big contributor to many of the difficult to solve health problems too many people are plagued with, it is a mystery to figure out  how these authors continue to think that eating wheat is just fine.
Anyone with health difficulties needs to cut out wheat FIRST  to find out if it is a problem for them because if it is, nothing else you do will ever work.
I believe this book tells the kind of advise that keeps people from ever getting better. I can not trust their claims that they got so many people better with what they claim works, and if I have to go on line to take tests, why buy the book?
If anyone is concerned with insulin resistance  go to YouTube and watch Jason Fung videos and get his book for results that make a difference  as dramatic as I only ever got from Atkin's before.
Most people who READ to learn about health problems will be smart enough by now to know to be very suspicious about the confusing advice given as fact in this book.","Misleading, Confusing and Inaccurate Information-",5,10/6/2016

33,1,A1P00M7SDR84JY,B000VMBYL6,"Having just reviewed diet books that turned out to be little more than fluff,  I got very angry when I expected this book to deliver some real information that would be of value to helping me reverse diabetes, after making a good start on doing it after finding the Jason Fung YouTube videos and book.
The trouble begins on page 5 when we are shown the first of a set of graphs. All the graphs have two lines, one representing glucose and the other insulin. Figure 1.1 sys each unit represents 10 ulU/ml insulin or 75mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.2 the same is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 20mg/dl glucose.  Graph 2.2 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 25mg/dl glucose. Graph 2.3 is 10 ulU/ml insulin or 100 mg/dl glucose. There is so little information on the graphs that they are essentially meaningless, even if the same scale had been the same on all of them.
Now on page 16 you are told that you can figure your body mass index on the chart 2.4.  but the chart has only height and weight boxes. Nowhere in the book are you told what to do with the height and weight figures tocompute your body mass.
The back cover says 'charts to determine your insulin resistance and check progress'  implying you will find this information in the book.  But all you get is a statement on page 27 directing you to go to a web site to do an online  'insulin resistance test'.
Having found the easy and dramatically effective information from Jason Fung that got my blood glucose reading down over 100 points in 3 days doing his;mini fasts' of no eating between meals for as little time as 5 or 6 hours, I was surprised to find on page 46 of this book the advise:
'Do eat frequent small meals, at 2-5 hour intervalsgoing long periods of time without eating only encourages more fat storage'
the book has pages with day 1,2 ND 3, Ec with about 10 blank lines to chart progress. You are directed to page 39 for information how to do this. Page 39 shows a representation of a scale with one or two circles on one side and one or two squares on the other, representing 'linking and balancing'  protein and carbs.  If you eat two each, then you have one rectangle of 'foods such as vegetables'  if you have one each you have two rectangles.
While there is a lot of test about eating fats,  the traditional last third of the book giving recipes stresses ingredients such as fat free margarine, cheese, and whipped topping '  and using 'sugar free gelatin (full of wholesome sugar substitute we were warned about earlier, and artificial color and flavor)  while we are told people who eat more dairy have less insulin resistance, but are these people eating dairy altered to remove fat ?
The book claims things such as that eating fat makes you crave more food, that you can not do anything to lose weight around your weight, and that  eating wheat is just fine, and wheat s the same as any other carbs.
I will stop here and address these last few 'facts'. This book suggests a diet very similar to what I ate all my life and got fat on, and could never lose weight until I found Atkin's.  eating more NATURAL  fats, and especially in meat, what we call fat but is actually connective tissue such as the thick skin on pork shoulder,  is what kept me from being hungry most of my life-and I almost never get hungry. It also contributed greatly to my regrowing cartlidge in a 'bone to bone' knee I was as told I could not return to normal by a doctor wanting to put in an artificial knee.
As for waist size, my personal research taught me that taking 2-4 grams of potassium citrate  twice a day ( intended to remove lead or other heavy metals from your system in 6 weeks, you will lose not weight but trim 2 sizes off your waist size in a week.  I gave a lot of friends I  knew at UFO conference the stuff  andevery one who took it  had their pants falling off by the end of the week.
As for exercise, I  also worked construction as a pipefitter for a few years and while eating a diet of protein and natural rbs similar to their 'pared' amounts touted in this book and I never lost an ounce.  In fact I never lost any weight in my life except on the Atkin's diet by first cutting back to zero carbs for a couple weeks, and adding very few back if I wanted to keep it off.
And at a time when most researchers are finding wheat is a big contributor to many of the difficult to solve health problems too many people are plagued with, it is a mystery to figure out  how these authors continue to think that eating wheat is just fine.
Anyone with health difficulties needs to cut out wheat FIRST  to find out if it is a problem for them because if it is, nothing else you do will ever work.
I believe this book tells the kind of advise that keeps people from ever getting better. I can not trust their claims that they got so many people better with what they claim works, and if I have to go on line to take tests, why buy the book?
If anyone is concerned with insulin resistance  go to YouTube and watch Jason Fung videos and get his book for results that make a difference  as dramatic as I only ever got from Atkin's before.
Most people who READ to learn about health problems will be smart enough by now to know to be very suspicious about the confusing advice given as fact in this book.","Misleading, Confusing and Inaccurate Information-",5,10/6/2016

66,3,A1J3CQAW3A4XHF,B001VLXML6,"About the Author
Jeri Smith-Ready has been writing fiction since the night she had her first double espresso. A steady stream of caffeine has resulted in twelve published novels for teens and adults, including RT Reviewers Choice-winning fantasy EYES OF CROW; as well as the PRISM award-winning WICKED GAME and SHADE. Her most recent release is the YA contemporary novel THIS SIDE OF SALVATION, which Booklist called a ""smart, unpredictable, and well-rounded tale"" in its starred review.

Jeri lives in the rolling hills of Maryland with her husband and two cats, who often play tag-team ""sit in the author's lap and keep her from writing."" (The cats, that is, not the husband. Though actually...) When not writing, she's either out running or on Twitter.

I haven't read Jeri Smith-Ready before and this was an introduction to the series, which in all honesty was a great introduction. I'm really looking forward to exploring more of this series. I haven't had much exposure to current adult dystopian so it should be a treat.
Plot Summary: Elysia is living in what's left of Baltimore. Seven years ago there was a great `Collapse' and mankind was returned to the dark-age, but with automatic weapons at their disposal. Gasoline is worth killing for, riots start whenever food appears, and money is worthless. Her former best friend, Darien, steps in just when Elysia is cornered for stealing a bag of apples. Together they escape Baltimore and Darien wants to know if Elysia is still being called by her animal spirit. He wants to convince Elysia to give their relationship a chance, and follow their inner animal guides to find a new beginning for mankind.

I was pressed for time today, so I decided to read this freebie novella I downloaded for my Kindle. It is the prequel story to Jeri Smith-Ready's Aspect of Crow Trilogy, of which I have read the first book, Eyes Of Crow (Aspect of Crow Trilogy). I had assumed this trilogy was based on a pure fantasy construct, but actually it's a tale set on Earth far into the future. This prequel novella tells the story of how our current civilization collapsed, and the group of people who became ancestors to the animal spirit followers in the Aspect of Crow Trilogy.

In general I'm not a short story fan, but within a limited number of pages Smith-Ready wrote a complete tale with a start, middle, end, and a romance to boot. Unfortunately we are not privy to whatever caused the collapse of societies' modern infrastructure, and we're only treated to details about the aftermath. Still, it's a good little story for anyone who wants to read, or has already read, this series.",Three Stars,2,2/11/2016
67,4,A359U0JFFZ0Q04,B0023SDPS6,"THE COLD DISH is the first in the LONGMIRE series. It's quite a bit different than the TV series.

First off, Walt is kind of a goofball, and Vic tolerates him more than respects him. That's probably not the case, but she calls him names like fat****. That would ordinarily get you fired in most sheriff's offices.

Henry is also bigger and seems to be a very good shot with a Sharp's rifle, the murder weapon in Walt's most recent case. Somebody is shooting four boys who were tried for raping Henry's niece, Melissa Little Bird. They were found guilty, but the judge gave them limited sentences in juvenile facilities.

Whoever is killing the boys is shooting them at a very long distance, 500 yards. Walt could make that shot, as could Henry, and Melissa's father. Lonnie, who's missing his legs, and Omar, a Buffalo Bill like character who's an expert on the Sharp's rifle.

In the middle of the book there's a kind of surprise. Walt is reflecting on his lifehe's met a woman, Vonnie, who seems very interested in a relationship. Then there's the surprise. Martha, Walt's deceased wife, didn't really love him. Walt stuck it out because of his daughter, who is now a lawyer who doesn't call her father often enough. I don't remember hearing that in the TV series. Vic is also enduring an unhappy marriage, and she cares about Walt more than she lets on.

There are some interesting minor characters: Lucian, the old sheriff, is living in a senior citizen's home. Walt plays chess with him once a week. In this book, Walt hires Lucian as a dispatcher for two days a week. He's an old-time western sheriff who sort of made his own rules as a case progressed, but Walt respects him and leans on him for advice. Turk is Lucian's nephew, an announced candidate for sheriff after Walt retires. Walt wants Vic to take his place.

THE COLD DISH is just another instance of the book being better than the TV show. Walt has a sense of humor in the book. He also has a great deal of respect for Native American spirituality. There's a scene where Henry is wounded and Walt has to carry him back to safety in the middle of a blizzard.  He almost freezes to death. He hears bells and sees ghostlike Cheyenne Indians who lead him out of danger, left with frost bitten ears and hands. You might want to read this section twice. I had no idea what was going on.

70,3,A3R6E2Z6NM2BKR,B0023SDPS6,This book is very well written but very confusing to read. It drowns itself in a litany of characters. The tv show made it easier for me to follow but I was a tad disappointed overall.,"Love the tv show, the book?",2,12/30/2017
71,2,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B0023SDPS6,"I guess Ill be in the minority on this one. The Cold Dish was unimpressive to me, and seemed a bit of a chore to get through. I almost cried uncle and jumped ship on this one a few times, but tried my best to carry on and finish.

The Cold Dish is another example of why I prefer standalone books to long series. This book works at a slow crawl because it seems to be a pilot for the first episode of many, where we get to know all the characters, their background, etc. Problem is, many of the characters aren't very impressive, including old Walt himself, and they seem to overshadow the mystery to the point where you say Hey, isn't there a mystery to solve here?

Also, the way this book was written was annoying and distracting. For one thing, there was way too much excess back story and exposition and the plot is very plodding and slow. There are some minor details that seem to trudge on and on interminably.

Moreover, many of the characters are interchangeable and forgettable. Many have a sort of smart alleck-y way of speaking to each other and seem to try to one up each other with silly, crude comments. It also doesnt help that Walts love life is constantly being pushed into the narrative too. This was annoying too, and it seems silly/unrealistic that many of the female characters are all falling over for him.
Often in this book things and dialogue about something comes out of nowhere and you have zero reference to what they are referring to. In fact, you sort of forget that there is a murder investigation that needs to be solved because there are so many sidebars and unnecessary details, these doing little to give you insight to the characters.

And, then all the mysticism added in seemed a bit forced and trite.

The descriptions of the landscape of Wyoming and the setting are somewhat of a saving grace, but not enough to save the reading experience.

In short, sort of an unremarkable reading experience. I don't think Ill be continuing on to see what becomes of old Walt. It seems from some of the reviewers say that the series from A and E is actually better than the book. Not sure if this is the case, but maybe Ill try a few episodes and see.","Weak characters, slow plot, weak dialogue, overrated",2,1/14/2017
72,5,A16ZB0PR9V6TJ8,B0023SDPS6,"Yes this story won many awards and spawned a tv series. Even reading it over again it touches the heart in so many ways.  The first time to meet Walt Longmire, Henry Standing Bear, Vic, Lucian and all the characters of North central Wyoming. The descriptive prose is worth the trip, but the mystery is great.  Somebody is killing a gang of rapists and Walt must stop them even though most people feel the same way. But Walt is damaged goods himself and he meets a woman that could help him. If only he could climb out of his own depression long enough. The two threads of the story twine around and around pulling Walt away. Until we meet the old Cheyenne in a mythic masterpiece on a mountain side in a blizzard.  Some of the best poetic writing I have ever read. In the end you long for more and the Longmire series begins.  Too bad the tv series is not as good.  But the books are excellent one after the other.

I have to add that the story is all over central Wyoming and Montana. Some places do not exist. Others are miles away from each other. The reservation is in Montana. The roads have the wrong numbers. So don't worry about any of that. Just enjoy the story.",Great writing,5,10/26/2016

Im very happy with this introduction to the leopard people, kind of like getting your feet wet before jumping into the body of water to get used to it quickly.

Also, its become rather rare in the Feehan world as of late to really have an artist male lead who gets a little flustered when his art is brought up. It was cute and refreshing. The cover finally got something after years of just really not having anything and the cover is not as amazing as the German edition but would still make me grab the book off a shelf to read the back.

I thought I would want the blurb to be longer but in just those few sentences, the author grabs your attention. The writing drags you into the rain forest and I could see everything that was happening.

A little mystery and action to keep the story interesting but a good, slow read that doesnt overwhelm the reader and keeps a steady pace for the plot.

While she has courage, she goes from scrape to scrape and, when Rule asks her - no demanding from Rule! - not to do something, she just plows on like a 2 year old bent on exerting her will. It just gets old after awhile. That being said, the characterizations for Rule, Horry, Pel and Pom are delightful, and the solutions Pel comes up with to help Horry are just plain funny. As always, Heyer can write some hysterically funny lines and scenes. This book is more a romp than a romance, as Heyer doesn't give the lovers many reflective thoughts, but you can see that love is blooming quietly, behind the scenes.

When I was not reading, I was thinking about getting back to the books to find out what happened next. Now that I know what happens next, I can reread the books, slowly savoring the character development and descriptions.

I have listed these books in one review because they are essentially one story, starting with Taryn's finding a griffin egg as a child. When the egg hatches, she is at a loss to know how to care for it. Her search for knowledge eventually leads her to another world. She finds mythical creatures such as minotaurs, wizards, and centaurs, only they are fiercely protective of their land and not friendly to humans.

As she struggles to survive, protect her griffin, and learn how to survive in this strange world, she comes to a deeper understanding of herself and her place in this world.

The themes I have come to recognize in Smith's works are all there: a heroine in an unfriendly world, beauty-and-the-beast, and the importance of sex as a means of communication.

The adventures she goes on to save this baby griffin is so heartwarming. There are also some truly laugh out loud moments.

Well written with amazing insight of human nature. Fabulous world and character building. Lovable and hateful a like.

There are adult themes with mythological characters who possess animalistic morality. There some truly frightening things touched upon. Rape being one of them. They are handled very well in my opinion. These are things that exist in the very real world. If you have a problem with violence like this, then this may not be the series for you.

 The next reason I devoured the book so avidly included the fact that Josh Gates is well-educated, and that is obvious in his writing style, grammar and vocabulary. It's VERY refreshing for me to have to stop mid-page in order to look up a word definition.
  This book is loaded with historical facts plus anecdotes as well, and since Josh received his university degrees in archaeology and drama, these little tidbits of truth and cultural oral tradition  round out this book with candid photos of the crew and their exotic locales.

A few twists and tunes, and the characters are pretty well developed. There are a few parts that could be edited slightly better, but I do know most authors on here prefer for their readers to help them out in this aspect.
It was not hard reading by any means, but it was also not an elementary level book. Be prepared for some love scenes. But honestly, sometimes they do add to the storyline, right?

This book was a little slow paced, but not bad. The hero and the heroine were nice enough, but the conflict between will/they or won't/they got old fast and felt as if it was thrown in for the sake of having conflict in the story.  Again, this wasn't totally a deal breaker and I did enjoy the story, to a point. The opening scene with the heroine coming across the hero naked in a river was great, short and very erotic, so I had high hopes for this book.

The real problem and what killed the book for me was the over abundance of long, long, long, sex scenes. I wanted a romance book and some erotic sex scenes in it would have been fine, but I wanted a romance book. When I want erotica, I look for books in that genre, not in the romance genre. I thought to myself, ""How many pages does it take to have an orgasm? Get it on already so we can get back to the bloody story. You know, that thing that interrupts the sex scenes, the reason why I bought the book."" To be honest, there were more pages of story than pages of sex scenes, but my gosh, those sex scenes were interminably long. I got so bored, as in "" Lie back and think of England"" bored.

The sex scenes were not hot enough to satisfy those who want hot sex scenes, because they were pretty vanilla. They would be good for readers who like sex scenes that are a bit sensuous without getting overly graphic. This book is in the sweet romance category, other than the sex scenes. I'm sure that there are a lot of readers who would love this book and it definitely isn't a bad, poorly written work. I simply detest romance books with what I consider to be too large a ratio of sex scenes to storylines. Very subjective, I know, but that is how I feel.

It was a decent read, but left me unfulfilled. I read book 3 - No Regrets, and the title was true to the book. Daisy and Aiden had no regrets about anything that they had done and just kept on doing. I just felt like the lesson here was that power and money wins over love. I truly wanted Aiden to end up paralyzed, pissing in a bag and Daisy living in a trailer park - that would have been an HEA for me (lol).",Unlikeable Characters,2,8/31/2016
111,4,A3D8KCB3IYM87H,B0049P1NQ2,"I liked this book overall. The first, daisys choice, was okay, a little unfulfilling. It did leave a little to be desired. However, when you read the subsequent books you understand it as a prequel, not a stand alone. It makes sense that it is a bit weaker or underdeveloped and rushed.
The second book was really good. I loved all the drama. I picked it up at 1.30 am read till 7 am, slept for three hours then woke up to read for another 6 hours straight. I was engrossed with this novel! And unlike many romance books this was a novel. It was a full fledge story with a thorough plot and complex characters. It read kind of like a soap but I didn't mind.
I know a lot of people had a problem with the characters. They are not the stereotypical protagonist and antagonist or hero/heroine and villain characters. They have both qualities. But, I am okay with that.  I am not afraid of flawed, messy or non good guy characters.
It was a tad long and redundant in some places but overall it was a great read. I love this author!",Enjoyed,2,1/13/2016
112,5,A295A2TPG8JJ7Y,B004AE34PU,"Edith Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY, originally published in 1942, is one of two classic mythological summaries most readily available to us today. The other (and older of the two) is by Thomas Bulfinch; it was published in the early 19th century and is commonly called BULFINCH'S MYTHOLOGY (a merger of three works originally published separately as THE AGE OF FABLE, THE AGE OF CHIVALRY, and LEGENDS OF CHARLEMAGNE). Both authors present a summary overview of myths once widely taught but now generally neglected. Bulfinch is much more extensive and includes numerous legends not covered by Hamilton, but the coverage by both of the Greek and Roman myths (for which the two authors are most famous) makes for particularly interesting comparison. Some prefer Hamilton's treatment; others prefer Bulfinch's. I personally prefer Hamilton's consistent use of distinct Greek and Roman names rather than Bulfinch's frequent and occasionally confusing use of Roman names to identify Greek entities. But I generally enjoy Bulfinch's slightly old-fashioned style of storytelling over Hamilton's (though, all things considered, hers is quite fine). Hamilton's work is still under copyright, and it is published only by Little, Brown. Thus, it is more expensive than Bulfinch's which, being in the public domain, is easily obtainable online for free or in very inexpensive editions by numerous ebook publishers.

Those who may own older paperback or hardcovered editions of Hamilton's work will discover the 2012 ebook replaces the magnificent artwork of Steele Savage with somewhat less majestic illustrations by Chris Wormell (though the list of illustration topics remains the same). The text remains unaltered, and the formatting is exquisite. There is an active TOC (here at the very end), but (disappointingly) no index in the ebook version. Overall, it is a very handsome ebook and a delight to read.

It is hard to imagine retelling the great myths in a manner more concisely informative than rendered here by Hamilton. Critical reviewers who claim she is too difficult or too dry are certainly entitled to their opinions, but given the nature of the material and the purpose of this book, I would respectfully disagree with them. There is, of course, no substitute for reading the full-length originals from which these great tales have been culled and summarized, but this is by far a much more convenient way to initially encounter them; that is why this book has been (or, at least, once was) heavily used in public schools in conjunction with teaching these timeless stories.

Edith Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY belongs in the personal library of every literate person as an introduction to, summary of, and/or reminder of these Greek, Roman, and Norse myths. But for added insights and additional myths, I would encourage readers of it to also obtain and read BULFINCH'S MYTHOLOGY.",One of two classic summaries of timeless myths,41,10/6/2017

It was nice to see Sophie grow up and start to understand the world that she was thrust into.  But there were times that I just wanted to shake her (much like Beth wanted to) to wake up to what she was doing was not cool.  But I had to keep in mind that she was not really an adult but just out of being a teenager and living on her own for the first time. She really did a great job of accepting where her life has taken her and worked hard to live up to her potential. The only part I didn't like was the love triangle that was starting up but that is just me.  But iIt does add to the story in many ways.

I could see people saying that this book is not suitable for YA but it has nothing that they do not see on TV or the internet every day.  There is a good bit of violence and sex intermingled but that is necessary for the story.  It is really for the mature YA or ones closer to 20 than 13.

The story moved very quickly and kept you on your toes waiting and wondering about what might happen next.  As a reader, you were not exposed to everything at once, but like the characters, you found out things little by little.  That, in my opinion, makes for a good story.

Football has become the sport to unite multiple alien races throughout the galaxy and the planets on which they live. Football has changed.  It is more violent and physical. Some players are even killed during a game. Mankind has evolved and many humans that play are 7 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds and have speed and athletic skills that we can hardly imagine. Top that off with aliens giants that are fast and agile and can catch passes 20 feet in the air and you are beginning to understand the game. Some players weigh over 600 pounds and can bench press over 1300 pounds.  The goal is to win and to survive!

Football was made a galactic sport to help the aliens and humans to learn to play as a team and learn to appreciate each other as teammates and friends. They are to be the examples for all the people in the known universe.  The alternative is hatred of all alien things and war..

Scott Sigler has written a unique Sci-Fi story that it entertaining and uses a sport as a means to bring alien species together.  You can see and understand the conflicts and the beliefs of the different races and how they learn to succeed as a team and through synergy achieve more as a coordinated team that they ever could as individuals.

The storyline of this book is well conceived and entertaining to read. If you love Sci-Fi and football then this is a WIN-Win story for you. I liked the book a lot and I rated it at 5 stars!

I have to agree with another reviewer that some of the personality changes didn't seem real. Ex. The mother in law suddenly liking the heroine, the story didn't clearly show why she made such a quick change, it just didn't make sense.
The plot was cute though and I liked that any misunderstandings were realistic and not over done and dragged on. The heroine didn't misconstrue and assume the worst once married.

I don't require total accuracy if the story is good (though I really love it when it happens!) but when there are statements like ""kick him to the curb"" and a remark about a ""date"" then I get a teensy bit agitated.  To my knowledge, people didn't date in the regency era.  And, one thing that really bothered me was the hero's constant use of ""kitten"" for his wife's name.  Ugh.  Instead of being cute, it was annoying.  When I was in high school a boyfriend kept calling me ""Princess"" even though I asked him not to.  It made me think of my uncle's beagle.

The story is fairly well written, though it has lots of references to the other stories in this series.  The references are fairly easy to follow, but make for a confusing start to the book.  The story itself is fair, but a little rushed-most of the book centers on the time before the characters are married, but most of the action happens after-it makes the end seem really rushed and doesn't allow for very good character conpletion of the H's brother or mother.  The sisters and the h in this book also do NOT in any way conform to the behavior of the time period-the way it seems that they have all entrapped their husbands by manipulation or idiotic behavior (as in this book).  The author seems to try and paint the picture that the girls are somehow victims, but their actions are totally inappropriate for the time period and would have damned their standing in society if they had actually behaved as they are portrayed.  I was also shocked by the several sensual scenes in the book and by the long, drawn out sex scene.  It was almost like the author was trying to give a biology/anatomy lesson in the middle of the book-not enjoyable.  I hadn't seen anything to suggest the level of sexual content in the reviews for this book and now realize that I should have looked at some of the reviews for the other books in this series, which sound every bit as descriptive.

I will admit, I almost gave up on the book, but the melodrama lured me further and further into the book.

However, significant sections of the plot are driven by a combination of factor a) the heroine has been kept super ignorant  b) her father is a super control freak who sees dirt and shame on everything  c) the hero has a Past  d) all his friends have Pasts  and e) their circle of friends seriously needs new people.

Now add in a serious helping of Big Misunderstanding, and repeat any time you feel like the book might be winding down.

If Big Mis plots irritate you, you may want to give this one a past.  It's melodramatic, which I found entertaining after a while.

The whole thing where the hero is led to believe that his bride is not a virgin and possibly pregnant when he marries her, so he stays away from her so she can't pass the kid off as his, so he doesn't find out that she has never been with a man before until WAY TOO LATE in this book kind of wore on me.  The heroine is seriously ignorant of the facts of life, and everyone assumes that someone else means something else when they say things.

For crying out loud: the setting is college, and it's about two kids in particular, as well as another, who are insecure, and it includes connotations of sleeping around and drinking alcoholic beverages and partying. I am nearing 60, so tell me if I think this setting fits adult contemporary fiction!

Secondly and most importantly, Ms. Stalling's theology is all mixed up. No, it's just wrong. There's no clear witnessing to others about making a profession of faith in Jesus Christ although it is sort-of - and that is weak, at best - implied, and Stallings places more of an emphasis of praying to the Holy Spirit and thanking him rather than making a commitment of one's life to Jesus Christ and praying to HIM! She furthermore, in my opinion, nearly makes the trinity of the Godhead sound more mystical than worshiping the Lord. I would NOT want a child of mine reading this so-called Christian fiction as it is misleading, completely. Yes, the trinity is God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, but one has to be saved as a Christian, i.e. putting one's faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and it is then and only then that one receives the Holy Spirit. When I thank the Lord for helping me, I do not thank the Holy Spirit. I do not tell others of the Holy Spirit before I tell them of the saving grace of Jesus Christ. This could have been an okay story had Ms. Stallings left the so-called Christian aspect out of it - that is the only reason I gave it two stars. Teaching wrong theology will eventually get one into trouble as it is false teaching.",Mixed up Theology or No Theology?,20,5/23/2016

In the Bible, it says we will be reunited with our loved ones, and that we will know them, but it never tells us how we will know them, but we do know that our spirit leaves our body when we die.

Now, having had a JC class on French, and, after reading thousands of books which contained dialogue and quotes in that language, I found those same portions, not just informative, but enjoyable ! I would recommend War n' Peace to Anyone who enjoys Reading and Learning. As someone who fancies himself a middling good Writer, I am always humbled when I read the truly Great Authors, and this re-read was no exception. As I told my Sister Carol, "" I stand amazed that Tolstoy's characters and events which occured over 200 years ago, can grab, and hold ,a modern reader such as myself "", but, I guess that's why both this book, and Tolstoy, are considered ""Classics"". Now, I'm debating whether to go read Anna Karenina, or re-read some Classic Mark Twain ?",""" Liked"" at age 15, ""Treasured"" at age 68.",2,6/27/2016
159,4,A11AZG938XL5UU,B004KZPK6K,"Approaching War and Peace feels like a monumental task. Sitting down and reading it is not for the faint of heart. The story is engrossing and will consume you. It took me about four weeks to finish it because it's not the kind of book that one can read straight through. One puts it down to think about it, coming back after one has digested what has one read.

Set against the backdrop of Napoleonic Europe, the story follows three main Russian families as they navigate the early years of the nineteenth century. Plot? Is there one? Perhaps. Perhaps not. The background history of the Napoleon Wars are what set in motion a lot of the action, especially for the male protagonists who fight in the wars. For the females it seems that love and falling in love and out of love and the passage to adulthood are what drives their stories. Our main protagonist is Pierre Bezukhov, a mirror for Tolstoy himself. The ideas Bezukhov spouts are usually the ideas Tolstoy believes in and wants you to believe in too. Pierre is the illegitimate son of a rich aristocrat.

The other families are the Bolkonskys and the Rostovs. The Bolkonskys are right and proper with an autocratic father from one of the lower levels of Hell. The Rostovs are more homely and not so rich but full of love. There are also a couple of other families that play parts such as the Kuragins, who play the part of the somewhat ""evil"" characters. The cast of characters is indeed large as many say. But honestly the main characters that the book follows number about 5 to 10. So it's manageable. Aside from Pierre Bezukhov, there is Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, Princess Marya Bolkonskaya, Countess Natalya Rostova, Count Nicholas Rostov, and Helene Kuragina. The rest of the characters are secondary and even Helene is not that important.

The book itself is hard to describe. Is it a novel? Tolstoy didn't think so. Is it history? Though there are huge stretches on the philosophy of history, this is not a history book. Nor is it philosophy. At leas not necessarily good philosophy.  It is something unique. Perhaps that is why War and Peace has attained the status of classic. It is a book that attempts to give one a complete (at least complete aristocratic) view of Russian society between the years 1805 and 1812. Perhaps the German word, 'Gesamtkunstwerk' - total work of art - should be applied to literature.

I read the eBook Pevear-Volokhonsky transalation that goes for $12.99. It was a good translation that captured the spirit of the times. The notes and translations of the French were all hyperlinked which made things easy enough to read and follow. Though I would rather have seen the notes on the bottom of each page rather than the end of each book. Having finished War and Peace, I am glad that I read it. Though I am still not quite certain if it should be regarded as such as a classic. Is it truly that great? I'm still not sure.",Not Quite Fiction. Not Quite History. Not Philosophy.

160,5,AOMDGKZTVIE9P,B004KZPK6K,"War and Peace takes place from 1805 to 1812 during the Napoleonic Wars that ravaged Europe. It primarily follows the lives of several Russian aristocratic families as they live their lives and cope with the world around them. This includes characters that go off to war and grapple with the reality of fighting and the ultimate question of what the purpose of war is. There is Pierre Bezukhov who suddenly becomes incredibly wealthy after inheriting his late father's fortune and spends time trying to seek meaning from life. In addition to this, there is romance stories, philosophical discussions, and plenty of action. Indeed, it can be hard to adequately summarize such a sweeping and long work as this.

Widely recognized as one of the greatest novels ever written, it is also infamous for being one of the longest. For me, going through my life with the usual distractions, it took a few months to make it through the whole thing. But after finishing it, I felt that it was completely worth the effort. Its length may be intimidating to many, but it is very rewarding book to read and ultimately finish.

I have a complaint about the Kindle edition. Although the text of the book is fine, I noticed many spelling problems with the bonus content and footnotes. A minor annoyance.

I was so looking forward to War and Peace as Anna Karenina is one of my favourite books. I was very disappointed with War and Peace as it felt like two very different books. One part is a history lesson in excruciating detail about the war and various theories on human behaviour and its influence on historic events. The other half is fiction about young aristocrats navigating adulthood and all its complications. I think this was done on purpose as Tolstoy wanted the war to be a metaphor for the coming of age of his protagonists but it wasn't executed properly as he focuses on the war more than his principal characters.

This book was written shortly after Tolstoy became deeply religious and all his characters come into their adulthood by some profound religious experience which I found to be unrealistic and preachy. I do admire and respect the scope of the book as it really does capture all aspects of life but it lacked that
indescribable quality that made Anna Karenina feel like a world the reader inhabited alongside the characters.","War, Peace & Life Itself",4,4/21/2016

I could see the truth in a lot of his motivations, thoughts, and actions from a male perspective. Nicely done.
The supporting characters are well done, for the most part. Alexs best friend is just what a powerful corporate raider needs. Natalies family is dysfunctional at best, except for her father who loves her, but holds a secret that may just tear the entire family apart. Her godmother is very proud of Natalie but holds secrets of her own that end up causing problems in Natalies life.
Alex never suspects that his plans to ruin a family name and business would end up with his own agony and need for something he never knew he wanted. Something he never knew he needed before.
The writing was strong, as was the plot and main characters. A couple of the supporting cast were a little weak, but I saw why things were done from a writers view point.

This story tells us the story of how Regina and Ben managed to finally get their HEA.  It is one roller coaster ride after another.  Great story line, great characters, awesome descriptions to details and fantastic dialogue between characters.

All in all, a fantastic book.

183,2,AQ619VL5LFGEO,B004RUXQGE,"""Belief is a powerful magic.

Valerie Diaz has a power that she can't contain, and it's killing her. Bounced between foster homes and the streets, she only has time to concentrate on staying alive. But a visit from the imaginary friend of her childhood opens a world of possibilities, including a new life half a universe away on a planet that is bursting with magic.

The Society of Imaginary Friends follows Valerie on a journey that straddles two worlds. In order to survive, she must travel many light years away to a realm where anything is possible. On the Globe, imaginary friends come to life, the last of the unicorns rules the realm, and magic seeps from the pores of all the Conjurors who live there. But choosing to embrace her potential will set Valerie on a treacherous course  one filled with true love, adventure and perilous danger.""- Amazon description

Doesn't this sound like fun? Unfortunately what it sounds like and what it is are two very different things. I almost DNF'd it at 35% because it was boring, annoying, and not well thought out. One of the most annoying things in the first third of the book was the treatment of Valerie's magic. Valerie finds out her imaginary friends that she's had from childhood are really real and projecting from a planet, called the Globe, hidden in a black hole. They inform her she had strong magical abilities and if she stays on earth she will die because somehow living here stifles magic (for the most part).  But before she leaves she has to go to England and undergo a test of her abilities. Whut?

First she is told she has too much magic to survive on earth then she has to travel from the US to England to take a test to prove she has all this magic she was just told she has? Then she has to go to Egypt to find the last transport from earth to the Globe. Not only didn't this make a whole lot of sense, it was boring.

Valerie is that most over used type of heroine- the Mary Sue, or in Val's case more like a Super Sue. Because Val not only is stuffed with all this magic and has these not so imaginary friends and enemies but she is Alone In The World.  Yes, my friends, Val is alone, so alone. She is alone, aloner, alonest. No one, no where, no how, is more alone. On two different planets Val wins all three Olympic medals for being alone.

Except when she isn't. No, really, it seems she keeps stumbling over another character that is alone for various reasons. This author desperately needs an editor or two because all this aloneness repeated endlessly just makes you want to throw something. Like Valerie. Out into space where she will be alone, so alone, no one will ever be... sorry, it's hard to shake.

Like I said I almost gave up but I pushed on and it got marginally better. Val arrives at the Globe and meets her imaginary childhood friend, makes more friends, acquires a magical sword in the best sword-in-the-stone manner, and keeps putting herself in dangerous situations because asking for advice and/or help would be the smart thing to do and a Mary Super Sue like Val needs to be smarter than most everyone else but still dumb enough to get tied to the railroad tracks or the magical equivalent.

So Val and her friends stumble around the Globe doing their level best to put themselves in harm's way and succeeding with tiresome frequency. She just can't bring herself to wait for other more experienced characters to explore and investigate but that doesn't matter because Val is a Super Sue and will prevail over all and manifest new powers or magics or whatever because that's what Sues do.

In the end she triumphs over her not-so-imaginary enemy and does something that hasn't been done in decades and good triumphs over evil and her magical power is awesome and rare and now she is the superset of Mary Super Sues. Except that evil isn't destroyed just dented a little because this is a 4 book series.

184,3,A2G45Q8V20R779,B004RUXQGE,"This is a good choice for a younger reader who loves Fantasy.  The world of magic (Globe),  which was secluded from Earth, has a lot of potential.  The writing was good, and the descriptive scenes were well done.

It took me a while to warm up to the characters at first.  I found it hard to connect with them.  But eventually their personalities won me over.  I remember thinking that the Unicorn was a bit over the top, but ended up respecting her place in the story.  Although there's much more to the story, I'm glad that it didn't end in the middle of an action scene with a cliffhanger.

My only issue was the flow of the plot.  It seemed a bit choppy and wasn't as smooth as it should have been.  Because of this, it didn't keep my interest properly.

This is a rambling series of vignettes that seem to all take place in about a years span of Tom's childhood.  He lives with his brother Syd, Cousin Amy and their Aunt Polly in a village along the Mississippi in the hey days of the riverboats and water transportation and the Pre Civil War era.  Tom is intrepid and mischievous and he's a fun scamp to go along with.  Many of his adventures are light and easily dealt with like talking a bunch of boys into getting him through his chore punishment, first crush, pretend games and late night outings, but there is a dangerous adventure that brings Tom and Huck to witness a murder and encounter some dangerous thieves.

I think I appreciated this more as an adult than I did as a kid.  It's rather nostalgic and I can see why Twain would call it his Ode to Boyhood.

It's actually a decent story but it was simply way too short and felt more like I was reading a few chapters plucked out of a novel. Both Roan, Addy, and her brother Jack were likable characters and the plot had huge potential, however, there just wasn't enough time for development. I have always enjoyed Ms. Templeton's writing though, and this was no exception.

On Thursday, October 12, 2017, I discovered that all of her Gothics were on sale for Kindle and in a rash moment, purchased them all.

I devoured This Rough Magic and to my delight, I still love as much as I did the first time and maybe a bit more as I now have life experience and can appreciate certain nuances now that I didn't back in the day. Much of the reason I love it is not only due to a complex plot and well-developed characters, but because even her minor characters have a few details that make them memorable.

This Rough Magic is one of my three favorites of hers, well-written, intriguing plot, satisfying ending, and characters that keep you guessing. It had been over 50 years since I read it the first time, but the details remained with me over the years. That's the mark of an accomplished author. So many books today are forgettable by the day after we read them; it's nice to be reminded of a time when the world was slower and people interacted with people instead of electronic devices.

If you haven't read a book by Mary Stewart, I believe you are missing a treat, especially if you like intelligent writing with just the right amount of description to bring the setting to life. Her books are reflective of the time in which they were written, so don't be surprised by the attitudes of the characters. Are our attitudes better today? Yes and no.

The story was in depth and without a doubt very well thought out. I have read the entire series before posting a review so I could review the entire series instead of just one book. I will copy and paste to the other versions as well. As stated Demon Souled was well written and proofread. HOWEVER, this is the only one I can say that about. Overall I read it all and was able to delve into the story, however the poor proofreading and grammar in some situations caused an interruption in the story. As I was reading I would stop confused and then realize he mistyped something or used the wrong word as a typo. Something proofreading his work would have corrected. His repetition often caused me to skip chapters at a time for details I got tired of reading again and again, just to get back to the story. It felt like filler material. I still give him four stars simply because if you get around those negative aspects of the books. The story is unique and compelling. Jonathan himself seems to be a great individual as he answered questions from me as I was reading the books.

Bernard is a young man, heir to a great holding, and under persistent pressure from his father to marry. However, when Bernard finally discovers the woman he wants, he finds that not only is she already married, but she is wed to an abusive monster. Joanna has been living in hell for the past year since being wed to Ralf. She has spirit, but sadly, most of that has been beaten out of her as she fears for her life. Upon meeting Bernard, she feels a spark of life and a desperate hope for a different future.

This was only 70 pages so you can predict where the story was going and what would happen to the villainous Ralf. Despite this predictability, I still enjoyed the story and thought that Gleason did a nice job introducing new characters for her other books in the series, while also crafting a nice romance that felt complete in the short page length.

202,4,A3I704B6J3MOT,B004X2JH5U,"The Lost Files are short stories that fill in details between the major Lorien Legacy books. Whilst it's not necessary to read them as such, they are well worth the read as they are full of great information for the main story, as well as really enjoyable in their own right. Each of the shorts tells another piece of the puzzle in relation to one of the Garde, or another minor character, giving you back ground information.
This particular short is about Six, and her past. Six was introduced in I am Number Four, coming to the aid of Four as he fought the Mogs at the end of the story, but we know little about her history, other than she has been alone for a while, and that her Cepan is dead.
This story fills in those details, covering the time frame from the landing, up until she heads off to find Number Four.
Again, this is a great fun read, nothing overly stressing, just an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon and get into an entertaining story.
For me, I actually found the writing in this one to be a bit better quality than I am Number Four, so I am not sure if each of the books is being written by the same person under the alias Pittacus Lore or by using that as the pen name, it has allowed them to get multiple authors to do the shorts as well as the main stories (Havent really bothered checking into it if anyone has, or does know?) Either way, the story line in this one was very good, and I found it interesting following how Six was Sorry No Spoilers!!
Needless to say, Sixs journey was a lot different to Fours and she had a difficult time.
It's worth the read to understand how she is different  thats what is good about these short stories.
If you are a fan of the series, this is a must read.
As I have said with the other books , this is no Shakespeare, so don't expect it, but do expect good fun, a bit of escapism and the great bit of Heros fighting off an evil alien race  just as this type of book should be.

203,2,A26F5B12T242LL,B004X6R8Y8,"genre: scifi/fantasy, some romance
setting: distant future, spaceships
format: standalone
mood: tearjerker
triggers: cliffhanger, sexual assault (off camera / before book starts)

This book has an odd disconnect that occurs around the 60% mark. Before that, the story is mostly a scifi/fantasy about a woman who escapes slavery and builds herself a new life among nice people. This part of the story is nicely done but a tearjerker. There is some romance, but the focus is on her building a new life. This part was 4-star for me.

Everything changes around the 60% mark. Instead of building to a climax and finishing this book's plot, the rest of the pages are devoted to a weird and incomplete new ""save the world"" thing. We only get the set-up, though, and it ends in a cliffhanger. The plotting and characterizations go from solid to kinda shoddy, with inexplicable acts of random stupidity (TSTL), characters behaving in ways that just did not make sense to me, logical inconsistencies, and characters we were supposed to like who act fairly despicably. Basically, everything to do with the ship's special cargo delivery is not worth reading. This means you loose out on a climax to the well written ""finding yourself"" plot; and the romance plot's climax is pretty pathetic. My specific complaints would be spoilers, so I will omit all but one (see below). This part of the book was 1-star for me.

Her paranormal abilities are...kind of a bust, in that they mostly only impact the plot during the end of the book, after the writing quality declines.

[*** Spoiler ***]

So, here is the worst of the internal inconsistency problems. Theoretically her dad is some sort of a great psychic with powers to foretell the future. Those are so spot-on perfect that he can commit a subject to a 350 year plan culminating in hiring a specific ship to carry a specific cargo at a specific time...but he cannot predict whether that ship's captain is good or evil; and he cannot accurately choose a ship to carry his wife and daughters to safety?

Let me just say I really wanted to like this story and am indeed curious as to where the character's story will lead in the other books, but I'm not willing to sit through the poorly executed writing style and lack of storytelling imagination to do it.
I found that 90% of the book was redundantly and relentlessly panning between the two characters while they tried to figure out if the other liked them or not, all while taking part in completely innocuous activities. This of course is established through assumptions and poor to little communication at a painstaking pace. The author mentions a few important events that are briefly touched upon in the book and quickly skips over as if in a hurry to get back to a character washing dishes or some innane thing, spending far too much time on surface character building with little insight. The whole thing read like:  'Oh, I was enslaved and torchured...but, moving on', 'by the way, we were attacked in space...but did you have a nice time making idle chit chat today?' I was about to pull my hair out from boredom and frustration until the very end when suddenly a slew of hurriedly- structured and choppy events came crashing down, one after the next. I was soooo starved for anything by that point that I ate it up with rapt attention. Even still, the author didn't really expand upon any of it, and was severely lacking. Anything of importance felt like a quick summation, even their bonding- which pissed me off as 99% of the book is dedicated to the extremely s...l...o...w build of their relationship which is so forgettable I can't even remember the character's names off cuff.

I have raised chickens from chicks for many years and while they are the best experience that I have ever had, learning before you dive into chicken raising is a must. I wanted to read this book since after losing my chickens about a year ago, I am looking to get them again when we move to our new home. So I wanted to read up on which chicken breeds are good.

I have had the leghorns, silkies, Rhode island reds, and Americana. Out of the ones that I have had I love the Americana, and the reds. The reds are great birds for our climate. They are hardier to the colds. The book goes into details on the best egg birds and the meat birds. I do not kill them for food, just eggs. I grow to love them too much.

To begin, I did not see the disclaimer in the synopsis when I downloaded the book; if I did, I would have skipped it, as I am not a fan of menages and multiple partner stuff, even if incubi may get into it. I should have read the synopsis and disclaimer more closely, so I can't blame the author for my error in judgment.
Anyway...I still didn't like the book:
* Profuse use of the c and p words. (Trashy - not sexy at all)
* Too many irritating editing issues, ie spelling, skipped/dropped words, clumsy sentences, etc.
* Semi-boring sex scenes.
* Weird plot issues...like when everyone is fearing for their lives in Ethan's kitchen, with danger approaching at any minute, the heroine's mind is consumed with wanting to jump Ethan's bones. I get it - he's a hot incubus. Still - I think the first thing in any woman's mind would be ""Who or what is trying to kill us? And - Let's get the hell outta' here!""
* A TSTL heroine...especially in the scene where she yells to a vampire ""Stop, or I'll shoot!"" Really? It's a vampire trying to kill your incubus/boyfriend, and he's coming after you next. To hell with a warning - roll up and bust a few caps!

231,2,AT0ZT3V40YVN5,B00507TKCW,"LONG review with spoilers.

This started out so promising, a 3 possibly a 4 star book with great writing, a dark and mysterious alpha hero in search of revenge and an intelligent heroine with her own, much milder past. At the 37% mark, thank you Kindle for accuracy, I had my first doubts then, later, smart characters doing stupid things ruined it.

Mikhael, the H has come to England to exact revenge on Charles, smug, self-satisfied, VERY ambitious fiancee of Sara, the beloved cousin to Hs BF. Charles is also a very evil doer. VERY as in not a fun bad guy, but a gross bad guy that needs to die a horrible death. [He not only owns various kinds of brothels (your run of the mill whorehouse, BDSM brothel where one can be beaten or beat, and, oh joy, a brothel that specialize in young children and virgins). Charles likes to frequent them as an avid customer as well especially after seeing his upper crust, self-contained fiancee. Charles the villain wants an earldom and wants Sara, daughter of a Duke, to help him get the status update. Sara was mildly crippled in her first season, lost out on love, and wants to get married, Shes a smart cookie, likes Charles enough, adores his daughter, and figures what the heck, so to speak.

In the quest for revenge, and to save Sara from marrying a sanctimonious whoremonger, the H seduces Sara at her own engagement ball. The shark started jumping at this point. From here on end, ranting spoiler

Under the ploy of telling Sara what a rotter her fiancee is, she and the H end up in the library during the ball. He doesnt just kiss her, but he seduces her to the point she is partially disrobed when her father, cousin, and fiancee come in. I did not buy it. Yes, the h was attracted to the H, but she is an intelligent and honorable woman. No way did I buy the nipple exposure. It was a cheap shot at implying overwhelming passion. Just as well he did it though, as Charles the evil fiancee not only calIs her a slut, but a cripple in need of a husband in front of her father and cousin. Excuse me, what a fine time for a duel.

The H and h end up marrying, and things are looking up. Then the revenge plot goes into full swing. The H is tightening the noose on the evil Charles. As if the brothels weren't enough, Charles has had people killed and arson set for a railroad deal. He needs to die basically. The H has such a specific revenge plot in place its ridiculous. The H wants honor in all ways

The H rescues Jenny, one of the girls from the virgin/pedophile brothel, while leaving the rest of the girls and children there. Jenny is one of the few characters whose brain cells function from beginning to end of this story. Shes a feisty and sweet girl who just wants a chance at life as well as a chance to spit on the evil guys grave. She ends up with her own little romance which she really deserved.

Angst, angst, and more angst. When I finally gave up the ghost is when the h finds out that Charles daughter was kidnapped in Jennys stead and was taken to the virgin/pedophile brothel. Jenny tells the h not to go, but the h has to rescue the little girl. Jenny says take lots of backup. Does the h take a battalion of the guards the H has left behind? No. The h runs off with the Hs turbaned sidekick to one of the most evil characters in the book. Spare me from good, smart characters turned criminally stupid. Really. One guy. One guy against the manager of a brothel that buys and sells young girls and children that are there against their will. The very brother that is OWNED by her spurned and vengeful ex-fiancee? If the h had been an impetuous character I might have bought it, but shes intelligent AND she has been warned and told what a total creep her ex-fiancee is. Right into the lions den she goes. To make matters worse, the evil ex-fiancee who monologues about the evils of women as he debauches virgins, pops into the room to check out the latest virgin only to find out its his kidnapped daughter. Hes horrified..

Such a promising start. Great writing, interesting characters, intricate plot, but the two main characters degenerated into such stupidity I couldn't get beyond it. The H I could handle as his reasons for wanting revenge are clear and understandable. ..[Charles the evil fiancee met him when he was ten and a slave in Tripoli (I think). Charles bought the H who thought he would be freed. Charles proceeded to sodomize him, beat him, then gave him away to be turned into a eunuch.

Oh yeah, and the evil fiancee mildly blackmails the Duke, the h's father, because her dad went to the BDSM brothel for a little paddling as he felt lost after his wife died. I guess that's the eighth stage of grief: spank me. The dad doesn't feel bad about encouraginghis only daughter to accept the creep's hand because he's still a gentleman.",Promising start.

Peregrine, a wanderer and a man of mystery, comes to London for revenge on a man who destroyed his life. Stylizing himself as a Prince, Peregrine enlists the help of an old friend, Ross Carlisle, to introduce him in society.

Lady Sara St. James, Ross's cousin, meets Peregrine and is immediately intrigued by him. Sara is sheltered and cosseted. She's done everything correct - as a proper lady should, yet Peregrine's wildness begins to rub off on her.

The only problems: Sara's betrothed and her fiance is who Peregrine has come to destroy.

A bodice-ripping historical romance, this was an interesting read. Some of it was overly dramatic and at times, it felt like a morality lesson. There's a continuity issue in the book, but not a major one. Just enough to make me recheck to make sure.

There is also some wonderful information here about parts of the world that I didn't know about and now have been researching for more.

In saying that, there's a scene in here that was uncomfortable. Other readers have commented on it and so I don't need to. All I'll say is if I'd known it was in the book, I wouldn't have read it.",A bodice ripper,3,3/1/2017

My conclusion is based on the disturbed leading man, Peregrine.  His love affair with Lady Sara St. James is spun out nicely with a lot of tantalizing ebb and flow, and the sex scenes are not forcibly graphic but rather full of allusion and figurative prose.  The author's command of Middle and Far Eastern history, geography, and culture was impressive.  Peregrine's traumatic past has, however, made him rather warped, and although the story is largely about his redemption from his own demons, I found it to be less than relaxing.

234,3,AIETQ2OOGUA7I,B00507TKCW,"This is a pretty good revenge plot with appropriate pacing and intrigue. The main thing I don't like is the heroine's rigid sense of right/wrong.

The characterization of the hero is more detailed and believable. Whether you agree with his method of revenge, he has justification. The author is trying to use the heroine's moral compass to rescue the hero, but in the process, I lost empathy for the heroine.

The hero (Ned) was not very likable. I had a hard time believing he survived being a war spy when his behavior was so foolish. Add to that a touch of self-righteousness and domineering comments --- well you get the picture.  Heroine (Jane) was a little better because she was so selfless and self-sufficient, but she also made so really idiotic choices. However, at least by the end, she could readily admit her errors in judgment. The back characters were well developed, and I actually liked them better, especially Violet.

The writing was very good, as was the editing. Thankfully this book was not all about the sex, even though a few of the scenes were explicit.

There were huge sections of the story that could have been fleshed out to tell a much better story that would engage the reader far more than this one did.  This story should have been one of those 99 cent stories as paying 2.99 before tax was way to much for such a pathetic little story.

Charlie needed a new start after being dumped by lame boyfriend, and when her aunt needed a little help on her farm, she thought of it as the perfect vacation. And once Charlie arrived, she found her neighbor Jason to be such a temptation. Jason's last GF decided she doesn't want to be a farm girl, so he's suspicious of any city girls, including Charlie. Then Charlie found a ghost in her aunt's dance hall... His name is Harm, and he died in 1936, after promising to elope. And his love's name was Charlotte... Charlie's great-great-great-grand-aunt. Charlotte died of a broken heart and never married, and somehow, both Charlotte and Harm are stuck on this mortal plane, unable to pass. Charlie promised Harm to help any way she can... and she'll need Jason's help to do it...

If you don't have a problem with the possibly of life on the other side, even teens would enjoy this story.  I LOVED it.  The heroine travels to a remote farm to be with an aunt that she barely knows.  Her mother thought she needed help after breaking bones in her foot.  She arrives to find a cowboy that just sets her off and the aunt is fine on her own but delighted to see her niece.  She finds a whole different kind of life from the one she had in the city.

She has a special gift.  She can feel energy and hear voices of those that have passed on.  She can also see spirits.  No one quite understands the gift and thinks she has a problem.  She has received such negative feedback when she has discussed her gift that she doesn't talk about it very often.  she arrives to her aunt's house, one that has been in the family for generations and immediately starts to pick up on a spirit in the house.  She is not afraid but feels the spirit wants something from her.  Seeing a picture of a long ago relative she recognizes herself as well as being named after this person.

 First off at a mere 90ish pages I would not call it a novel.
 It also ends very abruptly with a link to purchase book 2 which seems more likely that it is the second half of what should have been the rest of this book.

 Annie and Neal ""had to"" get married. Actually when Annie got pregnant Neal would have rather she had an abortion. He never wanted ""Baby Natasha"" and is not all that fond of being a husband either at only 21 years old.

 Neal works a minimum wage job and resents that he had to leave school to support a baby he never wanted.
 I read a lot of horror and I never really expect it to make sense so I have no problem at all with this story line of a 5 month old baby being out to kill. What did bother me was a couple of things that the author seemed to presume, such as one character mentioning that a 5 month old baby can't even sit up yet. Sure they may topple over but babies can indeed sit up usually any time between 4-7 months.  While it may be unusual for a 5 month old to want to kill anyone I don't see why the author would find it unusual for a 5 month old to sit up. He also seems to presume that breast size has anything to do with milk production. Hence Annie's thoughts that she needed to supplement with formula because of not having large breasts. Most of all what really grated on my nerves was that a character (Annie) who is so paranoid of crib death and who is always reading books on baby care would ever in a million years leave her baby in a car alone in a parking lot. No I take that back, what bothered me the most was Annie's baby talk. It made me want to throat punch her.

 Other than that, it was not a bad story. I mean who doesn't love a good evil baby story? But somehow even though this is currently free at amazon I feel cheated, because I thought this was a complete ""novel"" and not just half.",I feel cheated,2,5/20/2016

""We've Gone Too Far."" - ""The Expanse"" tag line

 Five EXPANSIVE Stars. Based on the novels of the talented two-man SciFi writing team called ""James S.A. Corey"" and also based on the Syfy Channel 10-episode production of their novels, this novella is from that universe. Set 200 years in the future, it shows how fractured mankind has become in this reality.

 The storyline of ""The Butcher of Anderson Station"" picks up with Colonel Johnson drinking in a bar served by a reluctant bartender. His feelings about 'Belters', those born in the weak gravity of the asteroid belt in the solar system, are about to take a sharp turn as he comes to grips with his past military encounter at Anderson Station, meets an unusual man, and he gets a fateful surprise at the end, as the storylines jump between two timelines, past and present. Fans of ""The Expanse"" may enjoy this highly-detailed prequel-like short story which explains specifically and graphically what the TV show jumped over about the Anderson Station encounter in Season 1, Episode 5, at 32 minutes in. Those not familiar with ""The Expanse"" may be left hanging, wondering what comes next, and go looking for answers in the other books or on TV. Highly Recommended. Five INFORMATIVE Stars.

This is an interesting read.  However, the science behind the plot is very thin. Assumptions are made that are invalid.  The editing is poor in places!  This is understandable because editing a long book becomes difficult because you see what you are thinking, not what you are reading.  The spelling is also poor.  This is sad because of spell checkers built into modern authoring software.  Also, radio protocol is invalid.  It really gets to me when I read or hear ""over and out.""  What does ""over and out"" mean?  Well, let's break it down.  First understand that radio protocol was developed for half-duplex radio transmissions.  Half-duplex only allows a speaker and a listener.  Both the speaker and listener cannot speak at the same time.  Therefor, bearing this in mind, I hope the following makes more sense!  ""Over"" means ""I am done talking.  I am turning talking ""over"" to listener.""  ""Out"" means the conversation is complete and the transmission is terminated, or ""I am leaving and ""out"" of this transmission!  So, now let's put ""over and out"" together and see what it means.  ""Over"" = you go ahead and talk; ""and out"" = I am hanging up now!  So it means ""you talk now and I am hanging up on you!""  Another thing that bothers me is the failure to understand ""chain of command!""  An Admiral's Second in Command is a Sargent.  Oh really!  A friend of mine's father was a three star general in the Army.  He had five aides to chaffer him, to cook, to keep his house in order, to schedule his time, and to act as his secretary.  Under his command were various generals, colonels, lieutenant colonels, majors, captains, first lieutenants, second lieutenants, sergeants, corporals, specialists, etc.  Each of the officers had responsibilities to make sure that all of the requirements of command were met.  Remember, the military is a giant bureaucracy with requirements for warriors and support personnel.  This concept is lost in this novel.

Summary: the novel just carries you on, but slows down with too many story lines.  Editing is poor.  Research seems nonexistent.  Characters are rather two dimensional.

Finally: despite my criticisms I have purchased all books in this series!  Why?  The best reason for reading a linked set of novels: I want to find out what happens!  I hope that I will not be disappointed.

My recommendation, buy the first book in the series and decide if you want to continue!

271,4,A3RK5D0VVDGCPP,B0055PMRSS,"As police procedural authors go, its hard to think of a more reliable or interesting one than Michael Connelly, who has been writing about Harry Bosch for more than twenty years at this point. Connellys novels are fascinating not just as mystery stories, but as snapshots of time  they're uniquely contemporary, reflecting concerns of the time, and letting Bosch and the other characters age in real time, more or less. His short stories, by definition, aren't as complex, and feel a bit less linked to their time and place; that doesnt, however, make them less engaging to read, just somewhat less rich.

Connellys Angle of Investigation, then, is interesting partially just for how its three stories ran the gamut of possibilities for Connellys Bosch stories, in all sorts of ways  focus, approach, scale, and even quality. For instance, one story, Christmas Even, walks us through the mechanics of a murder investigation; the second, Fathers Day, mainly revolves around Boschs skills in the interrogation room; the third, the title story, follows Bosch using his years of experience to unravel a cold case with only one real lead. It all serves as a nice triptych of Boschs skills, and a sort of mosaic that presents his strengths. More than that, each gets into a different aspect of Boschs life: Christmas Even explores his isolation and love of jazz, Fathers Day gets into his relationship with his daughter (a bit), and Angle of Investigation gets into his history on the police force.

Its the quality of each story, though, that tells you the most about them. Christmas Even is far and away the best of the three: it features the most compelling case, the most involved narrative, the best emotional beats for Bosch, and the most satisfying narrative that ties it all together. Fathers Day isn't bad at all, though; the interrogation scene is riveting work, and a testament to Connellys gift for listening as cops work their magic to get a confession that they know is coming  its just that the Bosch emotional beats aren't as strong. As for Angle of Investigation, itsfine, I suppose, as long as you can get past the least interesting story by far and a narrative that feels thrown together and barely holds up. Theres a great hook there, with Bosch being asked to revisit the first dead body he ever found on the force, but the story we get is weak, and far from Connellys usual careful work. Nonetheless, its a collection well worth reading, especially for fans; you have two really great ones, and even Angle of Investigation is intriguing for its window into a young Harry Bosch, fresh on the beat.",A solid collection that shows the range of Connelly's Bosch stories,2,12/20/2016

This book number four in the series just wasn't up to the usual standard I'm accustomed to from a Wentworth novel.  Plus, I was really disappointed because I immediately realized I had not read this one before and was looking forward to settling down with a good read.  Sadly, my hopes were dashed -- and I don't just mean on the rocks at the bottom of the cliff.

First off, there wasn't nearly enough Miss Silver written into this plot.  Just goes to show what happens if you leave your main character out of the action for too long.  I know Miss Silver is old fashioned, but she's smart as a whip and that's the reason I read these books in the first place.  A Miss Silver book largely minus Miss Silver is not going to go very far with me.

Second, this heroine is a drip!  And, drat it, she remained a drip throughout the whole book.

I'm okay with a heroine who starts out being a drip but somehow that needs to change pretty quickly or I end up irritated with her.  This was irritation run amuck.

The first story is about Maddie Cooper. Maddie just came from a Jane Austen tour from England and was so inspired to start her own English tea shop in Austin,Texas. And like Jane Austen's Emma, she thinks she is a natural matchmaker. Only to find out that she isn't.

I have not read Emma by Jane Austen but because of this book I wanted to read it. Jane Austen is like every girl's favorite writer. I liked Pride and Prejudice but I just hadn't gotten to reading the rest of her works. I will try find time to do just that. I will try to sneak it in between reading contemporary writers.

Just like drinking a hot cup of tea. It settles your nerves and it would make you feel like all is well in the world. The book is also funny.

285,1,A31OCPZKOOTDZS,B00586XP5S,"This was a novella that I couldn't stop shaking my head and laughing while reading - and not for a good reason. Not only is this plot over done (a blushing debutante is potentially caught in a compromising situation and now has to marry), but these characters were downright laughable (and a bit pathetic since we're being honest here).

But where to begin?

I suppose I should begin with the characters themselves. Elizabeth is supposed to be an utterly innocent young woman having her first season. Now that her father has unexpectedly come into money and a title, she now feels that she should be on the lookout for a husband. Unfortunately, the only man who has caught her eye (and supposedly her affections since she was but a mere girl of fifteen and she fell in love with him while he was defending his brother's honor and paying off her family to keep his brother from being ""trapped into marriage"" by her ""whore of a sister""). Not exactly the type of man I would go for, but whatever. When she notices that the man in question has disappears, not only follows him, but upon meeting him allows him to take her to a darker part of the garden and kiss her senseless. Now perhaps it could be argued that a girl as naive as a brand new debutante should be may allow this, (although I would then argue that she would have been raised better). but Elizabeth does not react the way a blushing virgin would. No, she is an eager and seemingly experienced participant - only regretting the turn of events when she is caught by the ton's biggest gossips.

Derek on the other hand knows exactly who Elizabeth is, but that doesn't stop him from toying with her. He takes her on outings where they spend time together (unchaperoned I might add), and he even takes her to an empty house that he has recently purchased and ends up bedding her. While he originally argued that was not his intent, it certainly didn't stop him from demanding that she undress and then giving into his baser desires. If he truly did not meant to bed her, than he should never have taken her to the home alone.

Somewhere in the middle of this fiasco, they end up falling in love (because they kind of have in order for this to be a romance), and even though he's treated her horribly, she forgives them and they live happily ever after seemingly with no repercussions whatsoever from their sordid and scandalous beginning.

I highly recommend it. The hero was yummy and so protective. The heroine was poorly mistreated by her father. I was happy to see the hero come in with his pack to save the heroine.

291,4,A1BRH1Y2RVCIJ6,B005A8SPU4,"I struggled with writing this review, because this book left me more torn about this series than the first one. I think it hit what I expected in a good way, but also hit what I also expected in a bad way as well.

The series picks up with the best parts of the plot from The Change: the Bachelor Battles, the rebels fighting the Network, and the dynamic Pruett family and their arch-nemesis, Rankin. In fact, I think the Pruetts do the best here, growing from just killers with occasional feelings to full characters. Angelica excels as a main character and her chosen mate after the Bachelor Battles allows her an opportunity to excel at something other than violence.

The problem? Two parts: 1. The editing is awful. She needs a new editor, pronto. The writing can be absolutely atrocious in parts - she's very lucky her story propels people along so well. The change in POV is actually welcome to me as it gives missing pieces of the action, but the writing itself needs strengthening, especially double checking typos and tenses within sentences. 2. There's an obsession about showing sex scenes between the females and their (sometimes willing) male partners. The sex scenes aren't written well (I'd say, level of 50 Shades quality) and often I think the story could have been stronger had she just had the character close the door to the room and perhaps have an observer note sounds outside.

The reason I gave this four stars? Its because of the story of the rebellion, the Bachelor Battles, and the Network, and the meetings with the different untamed populations of the world. She has a touch there that makes it really interesting to interact in the world of these characters, and the Pruett family dynamic makes them extremely interesting and often surprising characters to read.

I am very interested in finding out what happens in the final book in the trilogy, but I might also suggest some kind of free prequel about the history of the change and how it came to infect all people and species. The reactions of the other species in this book make me think it has the potential to be reversible in many species or controllable within this world, but we don't have enough information about the backstory to figure out more about it, and in her discussions of the change in the book we get the bare minimum about how it actually affects the females - nothing about how it works or comes to be.","Uneven in quality, but the story makes up for it in motivating you to keep reading.",5,1/28/2016
292,3,AAKO4YAM9BZE5,B005BXVG36,"This short story was originally published in ""The Mammoth Book of Regency Romance"" and will take most people no more than 20-30 minutes at most to finish. Except for one kissing scene with a little clothed touching, it was otherwise clean with no sex. It's about a young lady (Annalise) who is kidnapped on the way to her wedding by her own betrothed (Griffin) who's masquerading as a highwayman... Although a quick and easy read, it was just too short for any real growth or character development. I liked both Annalise and Griffin well enough and thought their romance was sweet, but neither made a big impression on me. Personally, I'm not sure I'd even pay $0.99 for it since its over with before you know it.

293,2,A3AM6MXENFRF3G,B005CM1S02,"This is my first time reading this author and was hoping for a lot more than this. Some of the reviews talked about how funny it was and while I found some of it pretty funny, for the most part I did not. Spoilers: First off the children in this are 7yrs old, not three. They have no discipline no parental direction and no respect for others. This is the result of a weekend disney land dad taking full time custody of them. When you're a weekend parent its all about the fun and the treats but when you have to take care of them as in this scenario its a whole new ball game. The 3 yr old in several scenes speaks more like a grown up than a 3 yr old should. On to the characters...I didn't like Murphy one little bit. There was nothing endearing about him at all. He was arrogant to the point of being ridiculous and he was a terrible parent. He is one of those parents who thinks their obnoxious brats are cute,They're not. Gail doesn't like kids but its never really explained why. Because she was raped by a cop? That doesn't have correlation to me and that was about as close to a reason as they gave. Other than that, she came across as a typical harried public servant with too many cases and not enough help. I didn't find her to be over the top with idealism but she believed to an extent in her clients, some may actually be innocent. Now on the the legal aspects of this. There are so many situations that are presented here that would warrant at the very least discipline by the bar if not dis-barrable offenses it is just mind boggling. Murphy offers a wager in where they will bet her clients possible settlement? Hmmm no no no, bad lawyer. She gets an offer of 10 grand and doesn't take it to her client? Nope again. Law requires that all offers of settlement be presented to the client. Here's another one...She thinks, well he's already breached confidentiality with his lawyer...again no. Lawyers have privileged communication that is a higher standard than confidence. Confidential information can be subpoenaed, like your tax returns or bank records, privileged cannot (unless there is death or other circumstances, threats etc). Then there is the fact that she is a Public Depender. That means her salary is funded by Public Money...She cannot take on a civil suit and the PD's office cannot take a third of the settlement on contingency. Yes towards the end of the book her secretary said something about not letting her boss know she took a case on the side, but if it was on the 'side' then why the 30% contingency? As for the fees incurred by the news paper the fact that the bill was faxed from the opposing client to her office with a communication to her about paying, that is just wrong on all sides of it. Fees are determined by the court. Opposing clients cannot contact opposing counsel. That's what their lawyer is for. For Murphy to blame her for her clients illegal activities was just silly and just emphasized his arrogance. I was really hoping to like this bc it seemed it would be different but all of the glaring mistakes into the Law and the Lawyers just grated on my nerves. I almost stopped reading it when he tried to wager the outcome of the settlement.

BUT, the protagonist of the story is just a B=tch who considers herself a witch and that leads to the part of the book that just ruined the whole thing for me .  The author makes it clear that wicca, witchcraft, druidry, and any other variation of similar paganism is dark, evil, and is only to turn people away from the true light of God.  The Heroine has dabbled and run away back to God.  Unfortunately, there are many who have belief in a Divine Spirit through non-Christian traditions.  We are not evil, we are not dark, and we don't disbelieve in the most Divine. We may use different words, but we still walk in the Light of Truth.

In this book, we have the story of English officer Ian Cameron following his rescue from two years of captivity in Central Asia.  All three books have as their basis happenings in that area of the world although most of Book #1 Silk and Shadows takes place in England.  During Ians imprisonment, he suffered mental, emotional and physical deprivation and torture including crippling beatings resulting in the loss of one of his eyes.  During much of that time, he was incarcerated in a deep dark pit along with a Russian officer who, after his death, tasked Ian with the delivery of his journal to his niece, Larissa Alexandrovna Karelian (Laura).

***Spoilers***
Lauras in India and that just happens to be where Ian plans to travel in order to try and pick up where his life left off previous to his captivity.  Before his captivity, he was engaged to be married to a lovely English Rose named Georgina and hes pinned much of his hopes for the completion of his rehabilitation upon the joy he will have in his life with Georgina.  Well, as these kinds of hopes go, this one simply doesnt work out since she thought he was dead and therefore moved on.  So now Ians struggles become even worse especially when he realizes hes missing out on one thing thats long been a primary part of any young healthy man's life   that would be sexual desire.  Yep, the beatings and kickings have rendered him impotent resulting in a severe depression.

In the meantime Lauras got problems of her own.  Her beloved English Officer stepfather has just passed away while the two of them were out and about taking care of his business in the Indian countryside.  This is where Ian finally catches up with her in order to deliver her uncles diary.  They become friends on their journey back to civilization; have some great adventures which include killing a man eating tiger and so on.  Laura has issues of her own that deal with a fear of sexual passion which she believes damaged her parents relationship and resulted in her fathers death by suicide.  So, although shes very attracted to men in general and Ian in particular, she plans to never be married.  So, we can see where this is heading.  What better way than to have some type of life together by entering into a white marriage since he cant and she wont.

So this is the basis of the story and I found it to be very unique and was enjoying it greatly until of course Ian gets well and wakes up with a very strong urge and Lauras reasons and fears for not wanting a real marriage simply become boring.  Thankfully, she takes counsel with a wise maharani who educates her in these matters so this hindrance to the story doesnt last any longer than necessary.  Ultimately, there is a huge military undertaking that will crush the English army resulting in Ian and Laura getting to save the day but not before Ian finds himself undergoing a huge challenge to his last remaining fear.

328,4,ASQW8Y9DY6LM6,B005FIN9YG,"Elmo Jenkins is a seminary student, and one the requirements for graduation is a six-month internship with a church. Ditched by his date at a fancy party, Elmo meets one of the ministers of the fabled First Church, and lands his internship.

First Churchs denomination isn't mentioned. It could be Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, or a similar group. If youve grown up within the boundaries of Protestant Christianity in the United States, the church is instantly recognizable  the megachurch with the big tall steeple usually located right in the middle of downtown.

Elmos office is (literally) a transformed broom closet in a large complex of offices. He begins to navigate his way through both the building and the churchs labyrinthine internal politics, politics that extend to the local business community, the seminary, and the country club. All-too-human frailties have to be dealt with. A minor 100-year-old mystery needs solving. And theres even the possibility of romance; actually, theres more than a possibility.

Ordained Irreverence is the first of four Elmo Jenkins novels and four novellas by McMillian Moody. Moody, who lives in Tennessee (where there are any number of First Churches to choose from), has taken a humorous yet rather fond look at institutions like First Church and the characters who inhabit them  the senior pastor, the trusted assistant pastor, the worship leader, and all the other people who comprise the staff of a large church.

Moodys intent isn't to poke fun and puncture balloons, but he clearly knows enough about churches to know that First Church isn't a completely fictional creation. What keeps the book from drifting into sarcasm is the understanding that, despite all the egos and foibles on display, Gods work is somehow getting done.

We can laugh at the inside church jokes and punctured egos, but Moody keeps returning us to the purpose of the church, and to the fact that even large churches, once you're past the glitter and theatrics, can serve good purposes. Elmo may be irreverent, but he knows what he and the church are called to do.","Humorous, fond look at big churches",7,9/15/2016

We all know this to be true, if you don't care for romance novels, then don't read them.

With this particular story I thoroughly enjoyed it.  There were twists and turns.  At points I cheered the characters on,  scowled at them for their immaturity in handling some situations, and took the journey with them in this book.  I also enjoyed some of the secondary characters such as Fannie, a married woman who wants everyone to have the happiness she found by being a matchmaker.  I also enjoyed that Sophie our heroine was a smart, intellectual sort,  and for a historical novel I found that refreshing!  The ending was definitely not expected, and for once I didn't find the ending rushed as I normally do with novels.  I thought it was well written, and the twist was a nice touch.

I downloaded the other five books before I read the free one thinking the price might go up, they were 99 ea. The cover and book description made it look enticing however, I was very disappointed. Even if the first book was free, reading the book chapter by chapter at 99 a pop cost me $5. For $5 I'd rather get a well established writer that I know will deliver and I can read the whole book at one time, not just six chapters. I won't be doing that again, especially since the second book was almost as short as the first one and the other four were not much bigger. I will say the storyline has promise though. I don't think the writing was bad after all it was geared for YA. I gave it two stars because of the length and because it wasn't much of a book as it was more of an introduction.

338,5,A2HKTEOHHU0CB1,B005H8PAQ4,"So, I started this book thinking well this looks like a cute, predictable, fluffy, HEA book that can fill some time. I WAS WRONG!

This was a fast paced, crazy, funny soap opera with well-developed characters and a plot that will leave you guessing and second guessing the outcome until the very end.  The characters have so many layers and the omniscient writing style lets you root and hope for all the characters.  I want the good guys to win but felt for the bad guys too.  Its a mind teaser that has you putting yourself in each characters shoes.  There is a heavy plot peppered with a bunch of subplots full of action and drama.  I actually was doing the DUN-DUN-DUUUUN!!! sound out loud.  It was funny and quirky without coming off stupid or droll.

There is some cursing, nothing you won't hear on FOX, and some sexual content, pretty light though and not smutty, and there is some blood shed but really not that gruesome but action and suspense all around.

I have to say that the first The Heat books in the bundle, I could not tell the bad guy from the good guy; as the heroines are ill treated by both.  I was yelling at the books to slow down and develop the paranormal world building.  The first book was really good up until the hero, who happens to be the chief of police handcuffs the heroine.  Then the book slid downhill for me.  I just don't like abusive heroes.  I can take an alpha man, but the need for abuse and the heroine supposedly getting off on the dirty talk by her kidnapper was too much for me.

So it goes with is compilation.  The author is a good writer, but the actual romantic stories is what I had problem with as I never felt a connection with her characters.

The sort of ""Romy and Michelle"" premise of a woman attending her reunion pretending to be something she is not--in this case, a detective- had a lot of potential, but I'm not certain the book actually achieved its goal.  It was nice to see a middle-aged woman as a well-rounded individual, sexual interests and all, but I actually found some of the characters on the periphery more interesting than the main character (i.e., the owner of the motel, the main character's two best friends).  They added a bit of comedy to what was otherwise a fairly dry tale. There were a LOT of characters, too, and sometimes it was difficult to keep them all straight, especially since so many of them had similar-sounding names, or names that began with the same letter (Rolly, Lolly, Christine, Carolyn, Murial, Missy...)  I wish all authors everywhere would learn to avoid that bad habit when writing!

367,3,A1YZCADBVKWC9X,B005L35E3O,"Read it for free. Thanks to the author for making it available to read for free.

Basically hero and heroine  are from two different cultures (hero human and heroine alien). They are translating and helping with negotiations for peace. They form an odd friendship. However, things turn for the worst when heroine is attacked by another alien that wants to mate with her so he can become king. Hero saves her but at a cost. To return favor heroine forms a bargain with hero so he can live and she will be free from forceful suitors. They mate but there are many obstacles  standing in the way of the couple (interfering family, heroine's father killed, hero being jerk because of old baggage he caries, heroine doesn't know how to feel, and  lack of communication).

This was a unique read. Heroine was very cold (literally and figurate). It goes with the personality of her people. Hero was physically attracted to her and somehow found her uptight and cold personality charming. He even says he missed her ""cold"" body pressing against him during their separation. It was out there let me tell you.

Also, hero himself was getting over a divorce. So he also had faults like comparing heroine to his ex when she was nothing like her. Takes a friend, that I could not understand why they were friend's since he slept with hero's ex wife, to tell him to his face he was being a jerk. In the end it was the heroine that makes effort to return with hero and apologizes. So even thought she was cold, she makes more effort to be with him than hero.

On side note, found the whole scenes with the little queen/king weird. Hero somehow friend's her and she later tells heroine she would take him  for  a mate. I swear there was more connection between  little queen/king and hero, than hero and heroine. Oh they say I love you, but I didn't feel it. There is a lost connection between hero and heroine. Felt it was the personality of the heroine and baggage  hero carried that didn't allow for that connection to form during the story.

It okay. If you like unique alien stories this could be for you. It has an almost rape scene, but no real details given, and one sexual scene that was different, for lack better word, than any I have read. Never found a cold body sexy. I thought those things shrunk in the cold (if you get my drift). Anyway, it ends with a HEA.",It was unique.,2,6/29/2016

I could not find any humor in this book that is described as ""funny"". What the characters look like is not clear and for the most part one is reading a book about people (or aliens) that are blurry in one's mind. There are very simple but also very annoying just plain mistakes in the book (like: why does the bodyguard of the alien daughter understand the human language if she is, supposedly, the only one who speaks it?)

SERIES: Rules of Scoundrels, Book 1
SETTING: early 1830s (post-Georgian, pre-Victorian), mostly London
THEMES/TROPES: old friends-to-lovers, coerced marriage, revenge, redemption, spinster, heartless hero, reformed rake, gaming hell

OVERVIEW:
Lady Penelope Marbury has languished in Society for several years after a broken engagement placed her desirability in question, turning down a handful of so-so suitors and, without realizing it, putting her sisters futures in jeopardybut her father is determined that its time she married. Hes added a valuable piece of land, newly acquired, to Penelopes dowry, and the suitors are about to come pouring in. Though she knows she wants more than a bland Society marriage, Penelope is ready to accept a proposal from an old friend and settle into a comfortable life.

That is, until another old friend, Michael, Lord Bourne, comes bursting back into her life, determined to have her dowry: the ancestral land that he lost on a foolish bet years earlier. Bourne has spent several years focused on two things, regaining his land and seeking revenge against the man who took it from him, and a wife seems a small price to pay to achieve at least one of those goals. His plan, however, did not account for the fact that the bride in question is the one woman who knew him before he was the dark, hardened Bournewhen he was happy, carefree Michael. Nor did he consider that his revenge might be something that hurts Penelope. And he certainly didn't consider that he might care about hurting her. It all comes down to a decision between the goal hes been chasing for so longas goal that has hardened his heartand giving Penelope the love and adventure that shes always wanted.

PROS:
Love developing between old friends is one of my favorite romance archetypes, so this storyline automatically appealed to me. The concept of Bournes goals, and his guilt and shame at having lost his land to begin with, are a fabulous background for the story because it puts him and Penelope in a position where theyve been separated for years and become very different people. Not only do they need to rediscover one another and their friendship, but his drive for revenge propels the drama between them.

The two characters are both well-rounded and interesting, and their relationship develops at a good pace. Penelope is finding the gumption to seek some adventure in her life, but shes not throwing propriety to the wind because she wants to help her sisters make good matches more than anything. Bourne is infused with a good amount of devil-may-care attitude with hints of solicitousness to show that hes not truly heartless. I like that he has a major screw-up in his past because so many heroes are so infallible. Bourne is constructed as a very driven character, so it felt believable that once he found a goal that brought out the best in him (namely, love and family), his drive would make him strive to be better.

The pace of the romance is fairly good, with plenty of trust issues because of the charade of a love match they put on for Society to make their marriage look less scandalous. Because they spend so much time pretending to be in love, there are points when the emotional progression feels a little redundanthe cares about me  no, that was just pretend  but he does seem to care  no, that was just acting againbut those emotional circles mostly make sense in the plot.

One detail of this book that I love is the use of letters as epigraphs for each chapter, starting with letters between Penelope and Bourne when they were quite young and continuing to letters from Penelope that he never answered and then to letters that Penelope kept writing but never sent.

CONS:
The one aspect of Bourne that I found a little perplexing was his very insistent belief that he and his life aren't good enough for Penelope. Perhaps if we got more information on the things he had done during the years when he was trying to earn back his lost fortune, this might make more sense, but the glimpses we get of the gaming hell he co-owns, particularly some details about how well-regulated it is and how well they treat their employees, does not paint a picture of a particularly dark life.

The plot was very much focused on their emotional progression, which is not necessarily a con in itself, but the plot could have had more interest by being a bit more eventful. I would have liked a bit more of Bourne and Penelope interacting with secondary characters. I usually love secondary characters, and I did enjoy Cross, one of Bournes partners, but there just wasn't a lot of the other characters in this story.

RATINGS:
Writing: 4/5 MacLeans writing is consistently good.
Characters: 5/5 Well-rounded and interesting.
Plot: 4/5 Could have been a bit more eventful.
Setting: 4/5 Bournes gaming hell is nicely detailed.
Romance: 5/5 I love a friends-to-lovers story.
Sexiness: 5/5 Well-written and integrated with romance.
Humor: 3/5 Touches of humor, but not much laugh-out-loud.
Average: 4.28 Great Romance Development between Old Friends

OTHER INFO:
This is the first of MacLeans Rules of Scoundrels series, each book focusing on one of the four owners of the gaming hell called The Fallen Angel. Penelope previously appeared in the Love by Numbers series as the betrothed of the Duke of Leighton, the hero of the third book, and their broken engagement plays a big role in how she got to the place shes at in this book. Reading that book before this one isn't necessary, but I would recommend reading this book before moving on to the rest of the series because this book gives good background on Penelopes sister Pippa, who is the next heroine in this series, paired with Bournes co-owner, Cross.",Great Romance Development between Old Friends,2,7/30/2017
370,5,A1GFLH8WYLHXZM,B005LC1NGW,"My favorite trope! Childhood besties! Michael and Penelope were the best of friends on adjoining estates. Life was good. Along with their buddy, Tommy, their young lives were filled with fun and adventure. That is, until life happened.

This story delves into the aftermath of loss, separation, grief, greed and vengeance. I especially enjoyed the running commentary provided by letters from home to and from the young Michael and Penelope while he was away at Eton. They emphasized the bond shared by the two friends.

This was somewhat of a dark story as the hero behaved a lot like a villain throughout most of the story. I really couldn't blame his anger and search for vengeance, but crikey, these are your friends and you want vengeance by any means necessary even at the expense of the ones who love you? Sheesh, Bourne!

Sarah MacLean takes us on a journey into the minds of her characters and you find that they are so well written that you will forgive them their foibles in their journey to HEA.

The ultimate villain in this story didn't receive the true comeuppance that he deserved. He was a vile man who deserved to be ruined, but instead seemed to break even. Maybe I'm just more vengeful than the characters.

Because I'm on a reread binge, I did note a couple of inconsistencies - Donovan West versus Duncan West in a later novel. There were several references to the number of ""men"" in the room and skewed gender references in several instances.

This book is a keeper for me and I enjoyed the reread thoroughly. It has been a few years so it was good to revisit these characters in anticipation of next month's new release.",Bourne and Penelope,3,5/27/2017

373,1,A1ZJO1QUDD3TI6,B005LVV6DI,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The amount of brand names mentioned made it read like an ad for some sort of high priced mall than a book and, at times, it felt like Knight was writing her description around the product brand. Rachel couldn't even just grab a granola bar, it had to be a Nature Valley granola bar. She can't just use eye shadow, it has to be Maybelline and I actually had to Google what a Filofax was. Turns out it isn't some sort of manila folder. It's a planner. Why couldn't she have just said it was a planner?

Aside from that, Knight spent quite a bit of time talking about Rachel's family only to have them virtually disappear shortly after. Her parents were terribly concerned about her sophomore-aged well-being but also allow her senior-aged sister spend the weekend at a college with her boyfriend? That's absolutely bizarre. I may not be a parent, but I'm pretty sure that's a bizarre combination. For the first half of the book, Rachel had to ask her parents for everything, then all of a sudden she's staying after school getting stood up by a boy and going to the same friends' house her parents told her not to hang out with anymore to get ready for a dance. It was set up for there to be some sort of rivalry between Rachel and her sister, Sarah, but nothing ever came from that even after Sarah made the cheer squad and Rachel didn't. Mark was even more pointless than Sarah and disappeared before the book even really started.

Rachel was low-key threatened by mean girl, Arielle, since the second day of school but, not only does Arielle never fulfill any of her threats, she disappears. Benji and Rob showed up at bizarre times and Rachel's insta-love with them was ridiculous. The only reason Rachel knew Rob's last name was because of the back of his jersey and she's already writing her first name with his last? Alright. Benji just appears, takes Rachel to her favorite place ever, saves her life then refuses to answer any of her questions. She does anything he asks of her to see him and then rides off with him into the sunset after he beats the crap out of her quasi-boyfriend and his homies? K.

None of the characters were developed and Rachel was basically 3 different Rachel's in 160 pages. The tri-Rachel's weren't even written as though she was coming to terms with who she is so much as if Knight had forgotten what Rachel's personality was supposed to be. First, she was a girl set up to have some sort of rivalry with her sister because they're complete opposites-Sarah's so thin and Rachel's not thin, not fat, but average, then she's a smart, athletic (lettering in FOUR sports), and put together young lady who wants to be on the science team and plays by all the rules because she feels bad for lying to mommy and daddy followed by being boy crazy, sneaking out of the house, ditching school and running off into the night with strange boys.

They also have different fishing styles in the contest. They come to realize they have different ""fishing"" styles but the same overall goal. I enjoyed this aspect of the story.

And he's been in the tunnels in all following events/books, including the Dark Forest Attack? Why didn't Fallen Leaves die? He's been alive for ages! Anyways, he helps Hollyleaf, (supposedly for company), yet when Hollyleaf is healed, Fallen Leaves now gets irritated with her? So he wants her to stay, and leave? And, Hollyleaf helps a fox cub!

She even thinks when the fox grows up it will be FRIENDS with her. Wow, Hollyleaf either is one idiot or she has lost her mind alone in the tunnels. Out of instinct, that fox while severely injure/kill her the first second it gets. Also, the book only covers a couple months of her life, rather than a lifetime.

394,4,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B005OLSNOK,"Johnny Truant is somewhat of a Renaissance man, having written a number of science fiction novels and guides to publishing, as well as being a former motivational speaker. That motivational speaking background is quite evident in ""Disobey,"" one of a series of free, short essays about the author's philosophy of life that are available on Amazon.

""Disobey,"" which originally appeared as a blog post, sounds like a talk that a motivational speaker might give, one that revs up his audience to do something. In this case, the something he wants the audience, or more precisely, his readers to do, is evident by the title, to break the rules. Truant, however, is not a wild-eyed anarchist who wants to tear down society; instead, he's got some very specific suggestions and some rather well thought out reasoning behind them. In essence, he's somewhere between a garden-variety nonconformist and an out-and-out anarchist.

Truant starts the book by describing an example of his own rule breaking: home schooling his son in accordance with an extremely unconventional educational philosophy. He then recounts his own history of playing by the rules and where it got him (Hint: It didn't go too well).  And then, Truant had his epiphany about the rules and peoples reaction to them. Namely, that the rules we live by are not like laws of nature. You cant choose not to obey the law of gravity and thereby float in the air; you can choose not to obey societys rules and risk societys scorn for doing so. Further, following the rules doesnt mean good things will follow, just that people are more or less normal. And by normal, Truant means conformist.

In reviewing Disobey, I don't want to judge it by how much I agree or disagree with Truants suggestions. Instead, I think the proper standard is how well he writes and lays out his arguments. And, by those standards, the book is quite effective. Truant has a way with words, writing conversationally and colloquially, with a good bit of wit (and, be forewarned, a few four-letter words as well). He backs his arguments with a few facts (which may or may not be accurate since he doesnt annotate the book), but Disobey never comes across as a scholarly or political diatribe. Instead, its a guy giving a talk trying to persuade an initially skeptical audience to buy into his argument, and hes quite good at presenting that argument in a handful of pages without resorting to sledgehammer tactics.

Like the other books in this series, Disobey is free on Amazon, so readers cant complain about the value of something theyve paid for. And Truant writes in a witty, breezy style, so the book makes for a quick, easy read that may even garner a chuckle or two. Readers can agree or disagree with his proposals and decide whether to try them out themselves. But there are far worse ways to spend 10 minutes on Amazon rather that reading Truants tract. You don't have to obey Truants suggestions to be entertained by Disobey.",Breaking All the Rules,4,6/13/2016

I see he's got several books.

If you walk around every day on eggshells, nervous about making a mistake or looking stupid, then you should read this.

If you have a ""next big thing"" in mind you want to do because you know it will be awesome (starting the business, making the big move, launching the nonprofit, writing the book) but are afraid of doing what it would take to make that thing happen, then you should read this.

The universe is very big. You are very small. In fact, you're so small and so insignificant in the big picture that you don't even register to the eye of the cosmos. The universe was here before you were born and will be here long after you're gone, and your life is but a blip on its vast, vast radar. If your life is to matter, it's not going to matter to the universe. It's up to you make your life matter in the only way you can: by doing things that make a difference to you, to those around you, and to those whose lives you touch. Time is short. You have exactly NOW to do whatever it is you're here to do, or to let the inexorable passage of hours and days and years kill your potential like fruit left to die on a vine.

The universe doesnt hate you, but it doesnt love you, either. Youre just an atom in its infinite workings. The universe doesnt care if you live, die, suffer, or thrive. Whatever your life here will mean is up to you.

402,3,A29MCZ55V6XTBV,B005OMBTKY,"Well, not really.
The author does have a point regarding 'take action and be all you aspire to be', but the point is rather weak.

Telling you that the pain you feel from a disease or an accident is nothing because it's just an electric current in your
nerves is exactly where this book fails. It describes things intelligently indeed but in an objective manner, whereas
our experiences are subjective.

Maybe, maybe it will trigger a Quantum Leap in Energy and elevate few readers' lives - deserving a 3-Star for that  -,
but for 99% of us responsible, careful, REALISTIC people, taking bold steps and trying to live out our fantasies
is a prescription for failure.

For the author, failure, pain or suffering as a result of ones actions are of no importance to the 'Universe' and 'pale
in comparison to the grandeur of time and space' , but that's ridiculous and takes things out of context.

Physical pain is real to the person who has it. Being poor because of not sticking to a job is detrimental to the affected person.
Becoming solitary because you decide to be totally different in a weird way etc. are serious impairments on individuals
as well as society.

The middle way is the right way. Unless you are Steve Jobs, or Elon Musk, or Einstein, stay within the comfort zone and
the common rules of society to thrive, and in your own free time feel free to invent, start your company, meditate or any other
creative path you want to take. The great Einstein himself kept his job at the Swiss Patent Office while developing his Specific

I'm not gonna say it was all a fun ride because there was genuine emotional turmoil included, but that just helped to make it such a good book. This world's use and acceptance of the reality of magic was seamless. It never seemed out of place for someone to be able to create symbols and unleash the elements.

Isabella is a strong and intelligent woman, as someone in her line of work should be. Her tools of the trade mix traditional spy gear with magical gear. She has emerald glasses that let her see in the dark. She has red garnet lipstick that, when kissed, allows her influence over the kisser. A wonderful blend of spy and magic gear.

My favorite part of this book is the entire cast and crew of characters. It's so easy to feel for the people she meets behind the lines, the people who have lost everything, the people who are tired of fighting but continue to do so. It is written in such a way that much of the history of World War II is still there, there's just magic involved as well. The people of Britain are still conserving every ounce of food and cooking with even the most disliked ingredients (liver sandwiches, bleh). The people of France are on strict rations with curfews and are killed on the streets if suspected of any Marquisard activities or sympathies. This book almost brought me to tears through its characters.

All of this and I've barely scratched the surface the Grey Tower vs the Black Wolves! The Order versus ""vampires"" that drink the blood of wizards to gain their energy. Plus, the hunt for Isabella's father who is believed to be a Drifter, a magician who can travel through time. There is just so much going on in this book, but it is so well balanced that it never feels overwhelming. It never feels like the author is skipping over important details.

This was a great read. If you like magic-in-the-real-world, or fictional stories set in World War II, or stories about magical forces at war with each other, I highly recommend this book.

Lucy's about to buy a house with her long term boyfriend and as she's about to sign the papers, he breaks up with her via facetime.... and then we learn that Lucy's about as emotional as a grape and the bf is weird and creepy.... and there's a lot of weird and creepy in this book.

The humor and quirkiness seem to come from the setting (new age wilderness wedding) than from the dialogue.  I felt like we got a ton of backstory on Miles (creepy stepmother!), but not as much for Lucy... whose friends leave a lot to be desired, including the bride and groom.  We know she's got an eccentric academic father and that she's trying to evaluate the men she meets using a spreadsheet instead of her heart.

He wasn't supposed to actually win and kill a Deathless! Siris returns home with the God Kings Infinity Blade expecting a heros welcome, but instead he finds himself tactfully, but firmly, exiled and wandering away. Turns out the people of his village are afraid hes only going to attract hordes of other Deathless in search of the blade. So Siris sets off towell, hes still trying to figure that out. Along the way he runs into Isa, a fortune hunter/assassin he gets along with pretty well when they aren't trying to kill one another, and TEL, a golem someones obviously sent to spy on him. And on the journey Siris starts to figure out some surprising things about the God King, the Infinity Blade, and himself.

Let's be honest, books inspired by video games just don't scream original or quality literature. So even though I'm a huge Brandon Sanderson fan, this novella has been low on my to-read list. At least it was until a friend (also a Sanderson fan) told me it was his favorite of Sanderson's shorter stories. Even so, after getting this for Christmas it's taken me two months to get around to reading it. And of course, now I'm kicking myself. This was indeed a fun and intriguing read. I know absolutely nothing about the game it relates to, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything in the story. I liked Siris and all his complexities. I didn't quite see the twist in his story coming for a little while. I really liked Isa. She's fun and spunky, and just crazy enough you never can quite predict what she'll do next. And then there's TEL, he was an unexpected but very fun arrival. Nothing like a worry wort golem to provide some humor. So yes, I enjoyed it and I've got the next Infinity Blade novella primed and ready on my Kindle. Perhaps my only qualm with the story was it was too short. I wanted to explore the world more, even though I know full well that asking Sanderson for more is asking for something that can also double as a door stop.

Neither of these books really felt like they fit together, and the ending is a cliffhanger, but I guess I deserve that for buying books that were made as a companion to a video game I don't play.

I am very displeased with the presence of DRM on this book. For more information about DRM, see drmfree.calibre-ebook.com/about#drm.
Basically, it is a scheme to prevent piracy of E-Books (or other digital media) that is a huge hassle for legitimate readers (In short, you don't REALLY own the book, so it can be taken from you at any time, and you can't back it up or read it on any other device if you did) and in most cases, can be easily circumvented by illegal means and Google, so the pirates can do what they like but the legitimate readers like myself can't.

Although it references earlier events, it explains those plots, especially in light of their effect upon the current story--which is helpful, because there are a lot of characters, all of whose lives seem to be greatly intertwined. The book is well-written and well-edited, and the plot is full of twists and turns (and not merely surprises relating to the mystery).  Each time I thought I'd figured out the relationships between the characters, or surmised what had happened or was about to happen, I was surprised.  The dialogue is delightful, full of quick repartee.  While not laugh-out-loud funny, there are a lot of amusing scenes, and there are almost as many that are a touch heart-breaking.  And although the mystery itself is neatly and satisfying resolved, there are enough cliff-hangers in the characters' lives to make it certain the reader will want to know more about them, and long to know what comes next.","Surprising, Amusing and Touching",4,9/12/2016
421,2,ABW8ZL231G2TP,B005UGMC78,"This story draaaagggggsssss on until I pretty much didn't care anymore.  It is simplistic to the point of annoyance.  The heroine goes to a bar at the beginning of the story with the express purpose of picking up a man in order to prove her libido still works after an abusive marriage.  Got it.  When she is successful, she throws away the opportunity (literally.  She tears up his number and throws it away.)  Why bother with this episode?  Oh yeah: so she can run into him in the new town she moves to and vacillate about whether or not to pursue anything with him.  Frankly, the majority of the story is boring.  Not having read any of the other Six Pack books, I was sometimes confused about which Coleman family had which sons.  The interjection of other Coleman families was confusing and unnecessary; Gabe is or is not going to transform his (apparently cruel father's?) ranch into a more financially viable organic ranch?

422,5,A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,B005UGMC78,"A stand alone read with a HEA.  It is part of a series but each book seems to be able to read individually.  This is a big family of ranchers.  All men living a man's life.  It is set in Canada in a small town.  Naturally the men are all men!!  They are rough, rough speaking, and lusty!!  it seems like a great bunch to me.  Sometimes the way of speaking makes them sound stupid when I don't think they are stupid at all.  The constant use of the word ain't seemed to make them appear uneducated.  Some have gone to college some stopped school at high school.

The hero is second oldest at 26.  He is quite the lusty fellow, he obviously knows his way around a woman's body and he loves sex.  Not a bad trait to my way of thinking.  He is at a point in his life where he is ready to get serious and wants the woman that is to be his life partner.  he has a secret that he is afraid will scare most women off.  Except the ones just looking for a good time.  He is tired of the good time girls.

The heroine, Beth, is a young widow with 3 young sons.  She finally escaped a very abusive marriage.  She was beaten down as well as beat!  She was very sexually repressed and had all the scars to show for it.  She was wearing a leg brace from injuries she suffered in a car wreck.  She is a school teacher with a strong spirit and she is determined to start a new life in a new town and get her family back on good, happy terms.  She meets the hero in a bar and later winds up living in a cabin on his families ranch.

There is a lot of wild sex in this story.  I would give it an 8 on a scale of 1-10.  So, if that is an issue for you, be warned.  In the context of this story the sex fit.  He was slowly showing her that sex could be fun and fulfilling.  He was just the cowboy for this job.  He had moves I had never heard of.  This man has it going on.  Plus, he has a heart of gold.  He is compassionate, loving, kind and perfect for the heroine.

Again, this is small town living, running a ranch with his brothers and dad.  They are not big city millionaires so the atmosphere of the book is indicative of that scene.  I really enjoyed the story.  One reader quit at a very early part and I think she missed a good story by not continuing.  But to each his own.,  I just think it is unfair to give a book a low rating and advise people not to read it when you haven't even finished the first chapter but everyone has a right to do what they feel is right.  I highly recommend the book.  I thought it was interesting and entertaining.  I believe the other brothers in this series will get stories just as good as this one.  They are all very interesting brothers, each with their own set of issues and things to work out in their lives.  A good read.

Wanting to start over and give her sons a better life, Beth moves to a small town in Calgary where she has a teaching job. It turns out that Beth moves into a spare house on the Coleman ranch and Daniel is a Coleman. When he finds out Beth is there, he is determined to win her over and not let her get away this time. She agrees to be friends with him with the condition they have 'non-vanilla' sex. What man would turn down a friends with benefits deal? Not Daniel. But he wants more from her so he slowly starts to break down her barriers.

I loved this story and the ranch setting. But Daniel was the best part of this book, IMO. He's a strong alpha male who is incredible in bed but so tender and caring to Beth and her sons. You just have to love him. He is my favourite book-boyfriend.

You have to admire a man who is so dedicated to helping a woman achieve her sexual fantasies. It's a tough job but somebody has to do it. But then he slowly inserts himself into her life. Even spending time with her boys and being a role model without even realizing it. He knows Beth had a lot of demons to get over after her life with her abusive husband so he has to be careful how he handles everything with her if he wants her to let him into her life.

When her friend Carley says oh that's just how Holt and his family are. They are popular and rich they don't hang around others.

Autumn is your typical teenager with way too much parental baggage. She knows way more than any teenage should know about her parents and the fact that she doesn't even want to be around them doesn't surprise me. So she goes to visit her best friend in Maine.

Holt is mysterious and kind of creepy. He just showed up at the airport when Autumns friend didn't bother to pick her up. It isn't like her friend sent Holt to get her, he just appeared. This entire airport scene is kind of baffling to me since there was no reason for Holt to be at the airport.

Samuel. He is mysterious and misleading. When he first meets Autumn, he is off standish and ignores Autumn. After some time, he actually starts to talk to Autumn and I think he might actually like her. However, I think Autumn was so wrapped up with him being ""mean"" and ""hating her"" that she seems to like Holt more.

Declan only wants to marry her off to a suitable man in order to protect her and her estate from unscrupulous men like her cousin, who wants the property for himself. Declan though, finds her spirited nature and beauty a challenge.
Will they get past their self-imposed barriers and discover love? Or will outside plots do the pair in before they can admit their true feelings?

434,3,A1WK64OV93G9TA,B005VH9IPK,"This is the usual historical romance, Georgian in this case. Pretty much formulaic. Beautiful but stubborn heiress in danger from greedy despicable relative who wants to marry her for her money and estate which he thinks he should have inherited, meets handsome man who has agreed to protect her until she is married to man of her choice; but, she falls in love with him and he swears he will never marry her. He is damaged from childhood emotional trauma and she thinks she can teach him to love. Blah blah blah...  I don't mind stories that follow a formula if the writing is good and in this case it isn't bad, but, the editing is terrible. H asks his aunt and cousin to be chaperones to the h and at one point they are at a ball and the text refers to them as his mother and sister; next paragraph they are his aunt and cousin again. Pronouns are confused such as he used when it should have been she, and vice versa. Frequently there is no separation between scene changes so you will be reading along and all of a sudden you realize one scene ended and another started but there was no extra spacing or a printed symbol to show the change. Many historical  inaccuracies such as h is allowed to meet with a man even without the usual chaperone of a maid. The H guardian often comes into her room at night without even knocking on the door because he wants to talk to her about something. She sleeps in the nude--back in those days women often didn't even bathe in the nude. But that way the H can see she is naked and get aroused--seems contrived. Guardian kisses her passionately often--not much of a guardian. Of course they are going to fall in love, it is telegraphed from the beginning. There is no suspense. Guardian lusts after h from pretty much the beginning, too, so you know there is going to be sex before marriage. The sex scenes are not terribly explicit but they have been caught kissing so many times the whole household has to know what is going on but no one objects--not even the aunt or cousin who are supposed to be there to protect the h's honor.

Dragon Warrior is book one in the Dragon Wars series by Shea MacLeod.

I waspleasantlysurprisedwith how much I enjoyed this post-apocalyptic adventure. The author thinks outside the box and brings together severaluniqueelements. 

I picked this one up; because of the title and the free status. I love dragon's and was expecting something along the lines of a dragon shifter in hiding or like the movie Dragonheart, but what I got was completelydifferentin that the dragon's are truefire breathingdragon's.

I enjoyed the worldbuilding, plot, Rain and Micah together andseparately. I wassurprisedby many events and plot twists and turns. The character andworldjump off the pages. The author does afabulousjob getting the reader invested into the characters created and pulling you into thisinterestingworld where dragon's are bad, humans fight for their lives not from just the dragon's, but from anothersourcethat once served to protect, and so much more.

The ending iswonderfullydone. Even though we are left with a little cliffhanger and some questions, they just add to the story making me want to pick up the next book to see what happens next, what is reveled, and how will these people change the status quo.

The only thing I felt needed to happen is that things needed to slow down a little more. Without giving things away, some major events happenbeforethebeginningof the book including a potential villain. The way this isshownto us left me hungry for more.

came to Socrates Cheng (Penn St.; China Studies major; Columbia U; JD, former attorney) a visit.
Chairman Chiang Kai-sheks $2200, 1927, Mandarin Yellow Parker duofold treasured fountain pen had been stolen from Li Bing-fas Three Prosperities China Arts Gallery (Georgetown).
Chairman Mao later had taken possession of it.

Li Bing-jade (Jade Li, Penn St. U; BA China Studies, Wellesley College; MS & PhD Philosophy Degree professor Georgetown U) was Li Bing-fas daughter, & Socrates GF.
That did not set well with dad at all, he disowned her.
Socrates parents are: Phillip Cheng (father, Chinese) & Sophia Cheng (mother, Greek).
The Washington Post headline read Chinese Embassys Diplomat Murdered in Chinatown.
Iris Hua (Lindas gallery director supervisor), & Linda Fong (asst. director) were employed at the Art Gallery.

The cultural exhibit show could not go on without that pen.
What did the note say that Socrates received?
Socrates had gone to the gallery several times to speak with the employees.
The next time he returned Iris had been murdered.
Detective Harte & Detective Thigpen (Metropolitan PD) had arrived at the crime scene.
Now FBI SA Ingram wanted to speak with Socrates.
Georgetown. Mr. Brandon Hill (Columbia U) had been stabbed 13 times.

Will the crime get solved & someone brought to justice?

I did not receive any type of compensation for reading & reviewing this book. While I receive free books from publishers & authors, I am under no obligation to write a positive review. Only an honest one.

A very awesome book cover, great font & writing style. A very well written international crime thriller book. It was very easy for me to read/follow from start/finish & never a dull moment. There were no grammar/typo errors, nor any repetitive or out of line sequence sentences. Lots of exciting scenarios, with several twists/turns & a great set of unique characters to keep track of. This could also make another great international crime thriller movie, or better yet a mini TV series. There is no doubt in my mind this is a very easy rating of 5 stars.

441,2,A39VYGNHLXAVMP,B005Y0NHTM,"I gave this book two stars, because there was some interesting topics explored, and the writing was adequate, without too many errors. However, if the book had been well-polished and edited, it would have been about 1/3 as long, as the author not only shows and tells everything, but then goes on to explain what has already been shown and told. Sometimes the author throws in the character's internal thoughts on what has been shown, told, and explained, as well. The main character's girlfriend never does just one thing; she winks, blows a kiss, and settles her flat bottom more firmly on the chair (I think the author thinks a ""flat"" bottom is sexy.). This may seem like a minor quibble, but believe me after a few scenes, the reader really begins to dread any time the girlfriend shows up. There is also an extraneous sub-plot about the main character's parents that is just sad, depressing, and makes the reader feel ashamed of the parents, and all for no reason, as it has nothing to do with anything else in the book. It doesn't even give insight into the main character's motivation or personality, although it does give the author the opportunity to further pad out the book.

The author obviously knows quite a bit about some of the subject matter and can't resist showing off that knowledge, even when it bogs down the story. Case in point - the Mandarin Yellow pen, as the titular item that has been stolen. A fake is introduced, and the fact that the pen is a fake would have been obvious to anyone with access to Google, but the author instead spends two pages going over ways the fake is similar to the real Mandarin Yellow, before pointing out the VERY obvious physical feature that shows it's a fake. When it comes time to reveal the mystery, the ""suspense"" is drawn out so long that is passes laughable and goes all the way to annoying.

Socrates: I will reveal the answers to all of your questions.
Villain: So tell us! If you can.
Socrates: Oh, I can! And I will!
End Chapter
Villain: So, whats the answer?
Socrates: It's very simple.
Villain: It must be, if you figured it out.
Socrates: You think you're very clever, but you made one mistake.
Villain: What mistake?
Socrates: I'll tell you.
Villain: So tell me.
Socrates: I will! After this suspenseful chapter ending!
End Chapter

Okay, so those lines aren't in the book, but you get the picture. After all that, the mystery is impossible to solve, as critical information is unavailable to the reader. The villain's motivation is paper-thin, and involves a complete personality change (although, I never did like the character, so perhaps the author did a better job than I give him credit for.). Despite that, there is little surprising about the Big Reveal, only another tedious recitation of facts that the reader had no access to and could have been delivered much more concisely.

I, personally, thought that naming the half-Chinese, half-Greek main character ""Socrates"" was a little cutesy. There are literally thousands of Greek names the author could have chosen that would have conveyed the character's mixed heritage, without becoming a cliche.

All in all, a disappointing read.",A tedious read,5,1/4/2017

Not to say that it was boring, just pointing out that, in a buffet line, there is more than one presentation because an audience usually has more than one flavor in mind.

Maddie Collins arrived in Texas after she inherited a old mansion that was sitting on a cattle ranch. She had inherited the house from a man that she had never met. He had been best friends with her dad, and owed him. Leaving the house to her, was paying off a debt that could never be paid off.  She was a very good chef, that worked in a Manhattan restaurant. The big-city girl feel in love with Texas and all it had to offer the first day. She had to stay in the house for 30 days. The only person she could sale the house too if she did not want it, was Boone Galagher.

Boone never got along with his dad.  He always dreamed of owning the ranch, and home one day. Now he finds out his dad left the house Maggie. The two has to share the house for 30 days. The chemistry between the two is instant. They both know a fling is the last thing that they should have. This could be a very long 30 days.

Maggie always moved around a lot growing up. She always wanted to belong some place. She had a craving for roots. For the first time she feels like she is home. Will she be able to walk away at the end of 30 days, and give the house to Boone? She knows how bad his father has hurt him. She is starting to really care for Boone. Sweet book.

Sample from chapter 8 - Maddie was always so relentlessly cheerful that he's come to think nothing could bring her low. To see that he was so very wrong struck him in a way that scattered his resolutions. Maddie needed someone. Right now, it would have to be him. She nestled into him and sobbed softly. Boone thought at that instant that he would slay dragons to bring back Maddie's smile.
Sample from chapter 10 - No words passed between them, but words weren't needed. Too often, words had driven them apart. Maddie slid her arms around Boone's wide chest and clung. Then the need for comfort melted like candle wax under the heat of a desire too long denied. She lifted her head and saw her yearning mirrored in his eyes.",Sweet romance,2,2/1/2016

Some authors are skilled with their descriptions, others with character development, others with plot. Elizabeth Marx is unusual in her mastery of emotions. Is she a perfect writer? No one is. There are some flaws in the book: punctuation and dialog attribution are two that come to mind. I sometimes had to backtrack to get it clear who was saying what. Those issues don't materially affect the reader's enjoyment of the story. Cutters vs. Jocks is a prequel to Binding Arbitration and, as such, it's a short read. It tugs at the reader's heartstrings and leaves one wanting to know more about the two main characters. Fortunately, Binding Arbitration is available. I hardly paused between finishing Cutters vs. Jocks and starting on the full length Binding Arbitration.

I don't particularly like the idiocy of heroes that just sleep with the heroines without any protection and act like it never entered their head there could be repercussions. The author should always work the protection issue into the story instead of making their characters seem irresponsible. I was so engrossed in Cutters Vs. Jocks that when it came to the last pages I was crushed Id have to be on hold, waiting to find out what happens. I guess thats to the authors advantage though because you know Im going to go right out and get the continuing novel, Binding Arbitration! I suggest the reader buys it right along with Cutters Vs. Jocks so you don't have to wait for more! Elizabeth Marx is a new-to-me author who will be bumped up to my favorite authors list! 4 1/2 Stars!",You won't want to miss Cutters Vs. Jocks!,2,5/10/2016
466,4,AN4B0UOJ3TLM3,B0064PJUWY,"Having read several of Elizabeth Marx's books, I have had this one in my Kindle app for a while but decided it was time to read it. Other books I've read by Marx were set in the South but Cutters vs Jocks is not. This one is set in Indiana.

Be sure, whatever you do, to read the blurb at the beginning that explains what cutters means. Having lived near a college town most of my life, I always heard of the town people being referred to as townies. Or I may have used the town versus gown dilemma. Cutters is an Indiana term that initially was in reference to stone cutting professionals.

Libby first meets Aidan while out for a night on the town. When the cutter girl beats the college jock at pool, he is taken with her. It turns almost obsessive in my mind but he pursues her like he has his baseball career in college.

I do not want to spoil the book but I will say that it left me wanting to know more. The book ends with graduation, when Aidan finds out that Libby is not just a cutter but also a graduate and a smart one.

The setting may be different from other Marx books I've read but Elizabeth Marx writes characters a reader becomes invested in and the reader wants more.

I am going to pick up the next book in the series, Binding Arbitration, now to find out what happens to Libby and Aidan in the future.",Great Start to Series,2,5/1/2016

I felt a connection to our H/h almost immediately.  We get very passionate lovemaking, somewhat descriptive.  We have suspense, intrigue, villains, humor, sadness, and just a darn good highland romance.

The romance builds slowly which made their journey of loving each other more special.

There is a touching ending, no cliffhanger so if you don't want to read about the other two brother's you don't have to, but please do because I can't wait for their stories.

I read some of the novels that I grew up with and got a treat to read some that I had never heard of and they are all wonderful. If you are easily offended by old southern racial references then maybe some of his work is not for you but I felt that he did not look down on African Americans because he put the runaway slave Jim on equal footing with Tom and Huck and he wrote from his time in history and it was the norm, the way people of different races interacted at that time. Mark Twain's novels are full of humor and irony, and some very deep insight into the workings of the human spirit and mind.

When he witnesses a murder on the train ride to Vienna, Austria, he is sucked into a whirlwind of death, danger, and daring. He and the beautiful Marie Andre, posing as his fiance, go to a tiny Austrian village very near the border of the Russian zone, where he finds a group of former Nazis living in the open, almost taunting him with their presence.
Dead Man Falling by Desmond Cory, is non-stop action a la James Bond, only, it takes place in the period immediately following World War 2, so there are no laser weapons or sleek cars, just good old fashioned guts and glory spying from the old school.
Cory paints a colorful picture of postwar Austria. He takes some liberties with history, for example, positing that Eva Braun bore Hitler a child, survived the Berlin bunker, and ended up in Austria with Hitlers teenage son. Youll be so caught up in the story, though, trying to identify the bad guys, you're likely, as I did, to forgive this bit of artistic license. Besides, he tied it up neatly, so history is safe.

I really loved it.  It is a book about sailboats and sailing as well as wine tasting and the growing of the grapes.  I don't know a lot about either so at times I was a little lost.  But the love story is great.  The hero is a professional photographer that has been very successful but is sort of tired of his life.  Since he was a child he has dreamed of sailing across the ocean.  As an adult he plans to do just that.  He is living in Washington state, has bought an old sailboat and is making her seaworthy.  He has not had a lot of luck with the ladies.  At least, not with a lasting relationship.  He gets plenty of action but it has never been anything that he has wanted long term.

The heroine has just lost her father.  It was just the two of them and they were very close.  He left her with a calendar and instructions to visit a new lighthouse, pictured in the calendar, each month.  On the first of each month she is to read a letter that he has left her.  She starts out on her journey to the first lighthouse on Puget Sound.  It is 1 January, cold and blistering cold.  As she is reading her first letter she spots a sailboat off in the distance.  The weather and sea is not even close to being safe for someone to be sailing.  But right before her eyes is this beautiful sailboat riding the waves.

This is the story of two people coming together first as total enemies that just rub each other the wrong way and can hardly stand to be in the same room together.  A lot of misconceptions are formed to make them think wrong thoughts about the other.  The story is really, really good.  At first I was a little lost but as the story starts to move along I got so caught up in it that I could not put it down.  There were a few times when I was really sad for her and her father, times when you laugh out loud at some of the hero's  blundering ways.  You love his little sea going cat!  Great side characters that will probably get their own books.  Descriptions of the Puget Sound and the lessons of the lighthouses are very good touches.

Two things are irritating - the main human character, and the writing.

The main heroine, Lee, is emotionally inconsistent.  While she is a heroine to root for in the first parts of the book, she does not retain her emotional appeal in the latter part of the book.  She seems almost distant from the Derf parent who fought so hard for her.  Certainly not enough meaningful time is spent with the two.

But the most frustrating part is the writing.  I found myself editing paragraphs WHILE I was reading them!  Ouch!!!

508,4,A3HEG0QCOK446R,B006GZ1VU6,"This book was a little unorganized I'll admit.  Its more of a base intro about the series.  There are sooo many characters.  She sorta had to explain the different types of species and lay the ground work so to speak.  She could have done it differently yes but it was not horrible.  Yes, there were some boring parts, but its not as tragic as some reviewers indicated.  Surprisingly I read book 2 and on from there and never read this one until today.  LOL...I know right?

Elizabeth is a bit to take.  She's the female version of a manwhore to be honest.  I didn't like her much in this book.  She seemed immature and unbending.  She used 7 men/shifters/vamps....yes 7 men for sex and it was casual.  Yes, they seemed ok with that but over the years obviously they wanted more from her.  They were all regular lovers so of course there would be some feelings.  I think what bothered me and no it wasn't her having sex with so many but the fact she was so unfeeling and arrogant to not understand the ramifications of her actions to their feelings.  Then....she THOUGHT after the collaring that it would continue...um really?  Then of course her mates found out how many and that initially she thought of continuing her activities.  Naturally they were upset.  In her defense she didn't know it was a mating when she told a couple of the men she slept with on the regular.  Of course now that she mated with them she doesnt want anyone but Axe and Ash.  So, it was a bit of a mess there for awhile and it was her doing and her actions do have consequences.  It just irked me that she was so oblivious to her decisions that it wouldnt hurt anyone.  Arrogant.  I have to admit by the end she changed and I do like her.

509,1,AUF0OPKICU6D4,B006GZ1VU6,"I suppose my dislike of this book might just be a matter of taste. I dislike slut shaming and you would think that the fact that this MC was sleeping with 7 men and standing up for her right do so would be a good thing, but it wasn't. It rubbed me wrong for a couple reasons. First, they were the 7 most powerful men in the area, all fighting for her attention (the old she's so special for some unknown reason trope). Second, they bought her expensive gifts, like cars, and sent her the clothing they wanted her to wear on their 'dates.' By 25% I'd decided she read like a high class prostitute instead of a sexually liberated woman, like she was the cliche sexually available woman who therefore must be available to all powerful men. Third, she'd described as 18+3, so basically 18 (this is stressed that she's 18), making her a sexually promiscuous girl instead of woman. Fourth, the antagonist of the story is one of her jilted lovers and it's suggested that her sexual activity was to blame for the coven's problems (basically shaming her past activities). All this countered by five, after one good f_ck she settles down into marital bliss and it's ever so much better than playing the field. So the whole story is basically framed around how much better being in a committed relationship is than not. Maybe not slut shaming, but at the least admonishing. Then we have the oddity of it being stressed that bears DO NOT SHARE, therefore her sexual behavior would have to stop when she mated. Then she mated two bears who SHARE her.

524,4,A372S9A7MJO1K8,B006KD2TP0,"This KA book is such a heartbreaker in so many ways. The h, Sadie, looks like a fairy princess but her father is a really bad guy. Her mother left when Sadie was eleven and she has not been seen since. Because Sadie's father is a crime boss, her life has been stifled and she has developed a cold, ice princess persona. The H, Hector, was undercover in her father's organization and was primarily responsible for getting him thrown into prison. Now she is unprotected and some very bad things happen to her one night. That's the setup for this story, which is really pretty good.

Here's the part I dislike, and it is a trope I hate. Hence the one star off.  If I have read this correctly, the H has a thing for the h. She is drunk one night and starts kissing the H. He then says something about her slumming with him, and she interprets that as him seeing her as a society sl*t. So she freezes up. After that is when her dad goes to prison, but H still supposedly has a thing for her. And of course, we then find out that the H has been smexing LOTS of women in the meantime. So many that when at a bar together, she actually meets one of those women who gives her a friendly warning about him, calling him a dawg. And that the other woman was with him 6 weeks ago, which coincides with the very bad thing that happened to the h.

My question is, and always has been, this - if the H is waiting for the h to make her move (which he said he was) then WHY do these guys nail as many women as they can in the meantime? They've known each other about 2 years or so. So OK, before they have even kissed I can understand it. But the H says he has been waiting for her for a long time. So again, my question is why can't they actually WAIT? The excuse given is that they weren't together then, so the h shouldn't feel bad. Right.

While I thoroughly enjoyed the Hunger Games books, I find The Bachelor insipid and boring.  Unfortunately, The Selection is much more Bachelor than it is Hunger Games and because of that I am not inspired or motivated to continue the series even though book one leaves the reader hanging.

Below are some observations I noted as I read:
- Selection process reminiscent of Hunger Games series, but with less emotional engagement or risk
- The Princes selection process is The Bachelor model for selecting fiancs complete with dates.
- The heroine whines about everything that is different in her life resulting from her choice to participate in the selection.  She made the choice to participate to benefit her family so suck it up, buttercup.
- The dialogue often reads like Mean Girls in a girls locker room a month before prom: gossip, speculation, backbiting, wishful thinking, will he/wont he ask me  out; wild jealousy when girls talk about their respective dates with the Prince.
- Silly names for the new countries: Swendway, Honduragua; feels like the author couldn't be troubled with more detailed world building.

However, I am amazingly glad that she loaned me the book to read. First of all can we talk about that cover? Seriously, of the millions and millions of covers it seems like Ive seen, that is definitely near the top if not the top one.

Cass does a lovely job of incorporating so many different twists and turns and story lines into this one. At the beginning I wasn't quite so sure I would like it, seemed a bit too Bachelorette-esque for me. But I quickly fell in love with her voice and her characters. One things for sure, her main girl, America (ignore the name, I never said it was creative lol) is a kick-butt, I-dont-take-nonsense-from-anyone type, which I love. Girls aren't always simpering and weak and needing a guy to save her. True, she also doesnt often think before she acts, which does get her into some situations, but for the most part she works her way out.

While I did highly enjoy this one, I cant say for certain that I agree with the script that they were going to use for a television adaptation of it. Honestly, Im sincerely hoping that Cass signed away most of her rights and couldn't change anything about it, otherwise I lost a fair bit of respect for her. She weaves this wonderful tale full of creativity, and then lets a TV network pick it apart and make it far more inappropriate? Yikes.

528,5,A6XR7Y415RPD0,B006KWAKDE,"I enjoyed this story very much. I liked America who really didn't want to win the handsome prince preferring the boy of the lower caste that she has known and loved for years. But he pressures her into signing up by convincing her that he would feel guilty if she let the opportunity pass her by. She is also being pressured by her mother who loves her but wants her to better herself it it is possible. America signs up never believing that she would be one of the thirty-five girls chosen as potential mates for the prince.

Once chosen, she is still determined not to marry the prince. She has a distorted vision of who he is. It isn't until he comes to her rescue when she is having a panic attack that she learns that the prince isn't at all who she thought he was. She still doesn't want to marry him, but she offers to be his friend. Friends are something neither of them have had before.

This was an interesting society where people are born into castes which dictate what sort of job is available to you. America's caste is composed of artists of various kinds. America is a singer and plays lots of instruments. Aspen, her first love, is one caste lower and is in service to anyone who will hire him. None of the lower castes, America's or Aspen's have enough to eat. That is one incentive for America to take part in the Selection, the meals at the palace are far beyond what she can get at home.

Life isn't idyllic at the palace. There is some rivalry between the girls who are competing for the prince though most of them do become friends. There is the requisite mean girl in the story who makes life harder for America than it would have to be. But the main problem is rebels who attack the palace. There are two factions - the North and the South. One faction seems to be searching for something in the palace and the other just seems bent on destruction.

529,4,A35K5OVNYUOP52,B006KWAKDE,"""True love is usually the most inconvenient kind.

Im going to start by saying that I had very low expectations for this novel. Previews of it Ive read and descriptions on various book sites didn't do much for me in terms of sparking my interest. However, I have had plans to read the first of this trilogy since the plot had been announced. And while Ill admit right now that the plot and writing were at times weak, it was still a very entertaining read.

(At the same time, I think it had a lot more potential to be something bigger than it was. But I don't want that to take away from the positives of it.)

Im giving off a bit of mixed reviews for this, aren't I? Id like to clarify before we go on that I really did like the story. This novel is solid enough to make me want to read the remainder of the series. Just had to throw that out there!

As stated, my expectations were low when the plot was at first described as The Hunger Games (I mean really, what? In what way is the plot even similar to that? Cmon!) meets The Bachelor  it lacked its appeal for me since Ive never been that interested in reality dating shows. And essentially, that is where the majority of our plot takes place. In the future country of Illa, the current prince must choose his future wife during a competition called The Selection.

And what do you know, we have yet another love triangle. Gag.

Im kidding  Im not bitter about that. See, Im not saying it isn't a tired road in terms of plots in young adult literature and television. Because in all honestly, love triangles are a prominent part of some peoples lives. But it would be nice to see a novel series not be about a love triangle. It would be especially nice if at least one side of this love triangle wasn't something of interest to me. Honestly, I enjoyed our main characters relationships with both Aspen and Prince Maxon.

Now, I could waste time and focus on other flaws I find throughout the novel: like the slow start to it, the rushed points, etc. But Im going to focus on the positives, because in spite of everything: The Selection is a promising start to a new series and is definitely going to cater to the romantic girls out there looking for a new series to begin.

America Singer is likeable in many ways. And though she isn't the strongest lead character Ive come across, she has great promise to grow in the remaining two novels of this series. I, for one, cannot wait to further get to know what makes her tick. And who she chooses. Maybe we can see more of her family, as well  it is very endearing how much she cares for her family, though they may annoy her from time to time. Her bond with her little sister, little brother and father in particular peaked my interest.

As for her mother well, she sort of irks me for the time being. But Im not saying I don't understand where shes coming from, because its easy to understand her character in the brief moments we hear of her.

(I particularly enjoyed her saying she picked herself. Though it won't last, and may not be the endgame of the series, it is always a favorite resolution of mine when it comes to love triangles.)

Im interested to know who Maxon picks, as well. Though America is in a love triangle, Maxon has his pick of so many girls  and he is a teenage boy, after-all. Im looking forward to reading into his mind more and more to get an idea of his feelings further. For his country, for the girls. I have a feeling his character is just getting started and may be a big surprise.

Im intrigued to find out what Marlees hiding. Im interested to see her friendship with America hopefully grow  how cute would a series best friend partnership be between the two?! Oh, don't let me down! Im hoping we learn more about her in the second novel. Everything we can learn about her, actually. And so many of the other girls in the competition. In all honestly, Id also like to see more added to the mean girl of the story, Celeste. Could there be more to her than what meets the eyes? Or is she just as vile as she seems?

And finally, Im pulling for Aspen. This may change, but Ill admit it that while I love Maxon: Ive been rooting for Aspens misguided care for America since the moment we met him. I think they are cute in spite of flaws and I have a soft spot for longtime sweethearts. What can I say? Id like to see things progress for the two again and hope they find a resolution for their problems before their romance slips away.

Maybe Im one of the minority but while Id love to hear much more about the royal family and Maxons relationship with both of his parents, Id really enjoy learning more about the history of their country. More than what we know. More about the rebels and the constant threats.

Now, I know what you may all be thinking  is it really worth the read? Youve read the hype, but cant help but wonder: what is it that this novel is about? Well, its part futuristic coming of age and part young adult romance. Which is hit or miss with most people. I cant say a lot happens throughout the novel, but if you are a fan of romance then this novel is probably for you. It is sweet, short and fun. Check up on it, kiddos.

530,5,A1LFSV7YAHSPYG,B006KWAKDE,"Rating: 4.5/5.0

This book is really a popular one and I had to pick it up as many of my friends read it. Some really enjoyed it and others did not like it at all. One thing I have noticed that most people who did not like it were actually disappointed more about the atmosphere of the book and the era it was set. Their main purpose of reading this book must have been ""to enjoy another dystopian book"". I can't blame them because in that area the book was not very deep to focus on the dystopian times. Actually many times I have been imagining this was set in the classical era of dancing ballrooms etc. Of course mince the jeans and other stuff. Disregarding the era that the story takes place in I have throughly enjoyed reading this book and felt the style of writing is very easy to grasp.

The story even though it is a simple one but written in a beautiful way. A girl (America) loves a guy (Aspen) who is lower than her in class. They break up, the girl enters into a competiton with 35 girls from different classes to marry a prince (Maxon). I liked several characters in the book and would love to know more how they will act in the sequel.

I highly recommend the book for the fans of young adult and romance genres. If you are only looking for a dystopian book then you might be disappointed but still I would say give it a chance.",35 Girls competing for one prince. Who is going to win?,18,3/15/2017
531,2,A1ZV39LB3IJXXY,B006KWAKDE,"I was looking for a quick, easy, light-hearted read... and I found it. The description originally intrigued me and I thought this might be something kind of fun. Unfortunately, this book was lacking in substance with a tired plot that's been overdone so many times that it almost felt like I could predict the next line in the story. The only difference is that some of these overused plots have been merged together... and not very well.

The setting is supposedly somewhat Dystopian, but unlike what we'd seen in Hunger Games or Divergent (books that have loosely been compared to The Selection), there is actually very little description other than rating people a number (1-8). Other than that, the world-building is seriously lacking. There's more of a focus on the actual dresses and the food that's served at the palace, while 35 teenage girls catfight over the prince's attentions. It was reminiscent of a bad reality television show in book form.

I had hope that there might be some redeeming qualities about the book. The heroine of our book came from a lower caste and was able to bring some of her experiences to the palace. Granted, these weren't exactly first-hand experiences... but she ""knew people"" who were lower caste. The relationship between the prince and America (yes, that's our heroine's name), was slow to build. She had left a previous love interest back home and was having a difficult time reconciling her break up with him. All in all, I thought that growing relationship between America and the prince was well done and very sweet.

In fact, I enjoyed their relationship enough that I went ahead and bought the second book. However, I'm going to warn potential readers now before they become engaged in this series --- The ""ex"" makes an appearance in the book and our heroine proceeds to start waffling back and forth between her ""ex"" and the prince, leading both of them on. Now I'm sorry, love triangles may be popular among some readers (I'm even a fan when they're done well)...

But when a love triangle is the simple result of a girl not being able to make a decision and stick to it... or even worse, misleading, betraying or cheating on the person she's leading on... I'm done. Not only am I done, but I'm downright pissed off. I stopped reading the second book at 30% and have labeled it as DNF (Did Not Finish). It irks me that these types of books are being marketed toward young women as though these are desirable traits. In what world is it ever okay to engage in that sort of behavior and disregard concepts such as honesty and integrity? Stringing two men along because you can't make up your freaking mind is not romance people! Sneaking out to meet up with them behind the other's back is not romance! It's wrong!

As such, I do not recommend this series.

532,4,A1HBTW5M7ZZ9PT,B006KWAKDE,"I heard of this book around the time it came out, but I remember it mostly for the drama the author and her agent caused. You see, there was a book reviewer who made comments about this book that the author and the agent didn't like. How did they plan to solve this so-called problem reviewer? Well, they talked (on Twitter & in plain view {get it?}) about ""liking"" the positive reviews, so the negative one could be buried. Well, the reviewer's very well known in YA blogging circles, honestly royalty when it comes to YA blogging ( I love her), so burying her review was impossible. What did the agent decide to do? She decided to call the reviewer a ""b****"". On Twitter. In plain view (love).

Now, this isn't the worst thing in the world, but it definitely made me question the morals of the author and the agent; and, thus, this book. But I suddenly decided I wanted to give it a try.

& I'm really glad I did.

This book was a very fun read for me. I mean, it's nothing like Amy Tintera's Ruined, a book filled with kingdoms and authentic intrigue, but it is interesting enough that I was pulled in from the first page. I would say this book's the perfect combination of literary and commercial; it has enough plot threads to have a deeper meaning, but the writing is so simple that it would fit for any story.

I really enjoyed America, though I felt she should have more self-esteem. Maxon was a stud in the beginning, but by the end he seemed like the guy who was amazing...but was a douche when it counted. Aspen was paper thin to me, but I loved May and America's mom. America's an insane name, like why would the author make the ending of this series so obvious(?), but...yeah, I hate her name.

Overall, I really enjoyed this book!",A surprisingly good read!,6,11/6/2016

This is not a complete novel - it is literally just the beginning! To summarize: by the end of this ""novel"", the Selection is not finished, America is still in a love triangle between Maxon and Aspen, and the mysterious rebels have not been quelled. Not one plot point is resolved. This book is merely the starting point of a swindle to get more money out of you to finish the story, which in this case is three more novels! I like books that come in a series, but each one should be able to function as it's own individual story. Unfortunately, this one cannot. I see the next in the series is $8.99 - forget it!

536,4,A1Z7XTVAWQ51W9,B006LS0PTQ,"Where to start?

The good: The plot of a wounded hero and a strong woman separated by miscommunication is not uncommon. The exact cause of the miscommunication, which is cleared up fairly early, is perfect, believable, and unique. I also like some of the other characters. Bedford and Meg are realistically flawed.

Not necessarily good:

I don't think the Bedford subplot added to the story. Its outcome was predictable.

The identity of the murderer also was predictable.

I was frustrated when Sophie and Keene arrived at the dinner party. It had been some time since I'd read the book about them, and I finally had to stop reading this book and go back to The Wedding Duel to know what they were talking about in regard to Algany. I didn't remember the other friends either, but I didn't spend time trying to figure them out. In other words, this section of the book keeps it from standing alone and will confuse anyone who hasn't read the previous one.

The bad: It needs a proofreader. It's full of missing words, words out of order, and wrong words. In one place, Captain Lungren is called Captain Unground!",Hot mess,2,7/8/2017

We build these stories because we have an innate need to want to be saved from our mistakes, to have someone strong to support us and a partner to share our lives. A dream of rising from the bottom to the top and getting what we have always dreamed. Reading others dreams always allows escape and interest, and I was no exception.

568,4,A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,B006MZH7XU,"This is a different kind of love story.  It is one that will make you think.  The hero is a wealthy businessman in new Zealand.  his young wife has died of breast cancer and has left him with a 2 year old daughter.  His sister-in-law has taken leave from her job to stay with him and help him get back on his feet.  He clearly wants her gone.  Or so it seems.  Lots of times things are not as they appear.  He loved his wife and was faithful to her completely but she is gone and he is hurting.  He has always had feelings for the other woman that looks so like his wife.  he has never acted on his feelings.  He made sure that he was out of town when she visited and he worked hard at keeping those feelings he experienced pressed down.  But now she is in his house, in his thoughts and within easy reach.

Most of the story is about the two of them going through serious bouts of guilt, despair, lust, etc.  They know that even though they never betrayed her sister there is no way the two of them can be together.  Society would never accept it and would think badly of both of them.  Until his wife takes control of the situation.  It was a good story.  Lots of sex so if that is a problem for you, better pass on this one.  it was a thought provoking story and I would definitely advise reading it with an open mind and heart.  A good read.

Just a personal note --  I have a young neighbor that has a story much like this one.  His young wife discovered a lump in her breast right after giving birth. The doctor assured her it was a swollen milk gland and to not worry about it.  About 4-6 months later the area became so painful that she couldn't stand to be touched.  After tests, etc. it was discovered that it was cancer, aggressive, and not much they could do.  I have learned that this age group for women has the highest rate of deaths from breast cancer.  I wonder if a lot don't detect it because it is assumed it is a swollen milk gland.  Anyway, she went through every treatment possible.  Chemo, etc.  Even some experimental drugs were tried.  Nothing worked and she just got sicker and sicker.  Less than 3 years later she had passed.  He said that he loved her and that if the cancer had not been there they would still be married today but that with her so sick she really left him long before she passed.  She did stay at home until the very end.  Her family helped him with her care and he had everything else.  He took care of the baby, worked fulltime, prepared all the meals and did the housework.  I really don't know how he did what he did at such a young age himself.  So this story I just read could have been his in a way.  We just don't know what a surviving spouse goes through emotionally, physically, etc. so it is very unfair for the rest of use to pass judgment on them for what they do or don't do.  I really think the hero in our story loved his wife.  I think he probably lusted after the sister!!  But then I think he did love her at the end.  My friend did eventually marry again.  And, he seems to be happy.

1) Do I want to keep reading (Answer was yes);
2) Do the characters annoy me? (No -- when they do, a fatal flag in escapist writing genres for me);
3) Does there seem to be good sexual and mental chemistry between the main characters?  (Yes!  The author really conveys a very strong passionately sexual tension and this can be graphic, so be forewarned)
4) Does the heroine have some backbone and intellect? (this isn't a requirement to enjoy a hist romance, but it puts it over the top -- and this was the case here)

She ends up in his household working at decoding cryptic notes detailing an assassination attempt as well as to receive lessons in becoming a courtesan so that she can earn money to support her invalid brother.
While I enjoy Ms. Pearce's work, this one was kind of a mess. You had the dark 'alpha' Duke, the plain bluestocking virgin, a spy caper, the evil gambling stepfather, the first wife who betrayed the Duke, and several other tropes one can find in a Regency romance. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind tropes, but this book seemed to throw them all in without following through to a logical conclusion or giving good backstory to explain whatever was going on. There wasn't much real connection between the hero and heroine, at least in my opinion. He didn't always seem that interested in even forwarding her 'education' at times.

So that she can support her invalid brother all but disowned by their family. The Duke, tempted by this strong young women who can think, asked for her help in thwarting an assassination plot against the prince regent by decoding some messages in addition to teaching her about the bedroom skills. As the two are ever drawn closer to each other, they are endangered by the plot that was closer than they ever suspect...

The mystery was intriguing, and the characters had a lot of depth to them. I was trying to solve the mystery and piece together all the small town relationships. I connected with the main characters and liked that they had a colorful history with good and bad points. They had flaws and strong attributes.

The setting and atmosphere was nicely described. And sheesh, do I understand lake effect! I remember the November we had a unbelievable amount of snow.

Full disclosure, I did hit about 40% and feel like my interest had piqued. At that point I was ready for the story to be wrapping up, and clearly I wasn't close.

PART OF THE REVIEW:
It's one of my constant reminders to authors (Indies, Experience, Big Names, etc) fond of writing books without always use cliffhangers or because the 1st book sold well the 2nd the price higher up. When you see the rest of the books are almost for Free, so: ""BABY STEPS"".

An big seller of ""books"" could do that, had many loyal readers until they decide ""not anymore"", I wrote by experience (my favorite character was leave hanging trying to bring, what I called ""new blood"", to the series, that never ends with a ""cliffhanger"").

What happens, Oh, Damn...""Big Name Author"", wrote the main character as paint on the Wall, almost invisible and the ""new ones"" got the ""mains"". Also, got parts of almost all the series and ""create"", HA HA"", a ""new book"". The End, m many Readers said: ""BYE, Big Author, Not a penny more from Me and the Reviews were Terrible"".

Please, Authors...read the Reviews, your ARC's and beware that could be the End of many Careers.

I'm very honest with my Reviews, not only for me, the author or other readers, how an author know when did something good or need improvement?

How another reader believe in my review? If I didn't read the book, I don't Review. If the book is good, Review. If the book isn't good, Review.

Instead, one simple sentence stating his reason for anger followed by an angry reaction would have been sufficient.

First time I read something by David Adams was in the SF anthology&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Robot-Chronicles-The-Future-Chronicles/dp/B00M3GIBUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Robot Chronicles (The Future Chronicles)</a>&nbsp;and found his short story so good that I wanted to read his first full length novel in the Lacuna series. As some points out this is not a 5-star book, but good enough for me.

Some feedback if David still have time to read feedback.

The staff aboard the star-ship are using hand held com-radios, walkies-talkies, and punches computer keyboards in the year 2035! Already in the 50-ies airplane pilots and tank crews were using headphones and throat mikes. I guess absolutely everything will be voice and eye-controlled by 2035, if not implant controlled. Military reality will be experienced thru a VR-interface, not IRL. This book was published 2012 but NASA used VR already in the 90-ies and US Army in the 80-ies. The Field Commanders in 2035 will be way back and a soldier is walking up to the alien with a full VR on-line.

e-bay will probably be bought by the 3-4 times bigger Alibaba company shortly.

If typos can be fixed, I hope archaic clicking keyboards and crackling walkies-talkies also can be replaced. It disturbs me more than typos and black-box technology ;)

P.S. The space-ship's rail-gun is truly awesome. The bullet weighting 6kg with a speed of 30,000km/sec has a kinetic energy of 4 times the 16 Kilotonne A-bomb over Hiroshima. Top rail gun designs currently [2003] can launch a 2kg projectile with a muzzle velocity of close to 4km/s on roughly 6 meter rails. To reach this kind of velocity (4km/s), the power source must provide roughly 6.5 million Amps. Multiply several 1000 times to attain 30,000km/s. Ouch.

Hard also to believe Beijing's rail-gun could have hit the alien spaceship at L4 or L5 with several bullets, the L4 and L5 are rather large volumes of space (more than several 1,000 times bigger than Jupiter itself) containing millions of asteroids and rocks. The crew would have little idea where inside this astronomical volume of space the ship would care to stop before space jumping.

P.P.S. After reading 50% I have to quit. Too little science, mostly fiction. Lagrange ""points"" are not points, but vast volumes of space, like zones. They are thousands of times bigger than Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Earth etc Each planet have their own Lagrange zones relative to the sun and each other and their moons. See image at https://i.stack.imgur.com/om9i5.png for getting the size of Jupiter's L4 and L5. The green clouds are Lagrange ""points"" and the little red dot is Jupiter.

Throwing nukes in these titanic zones, to hit and destroy a space-ship is like throwing a few grams of burning magnesium in the Pacific ocean, hoping to hit and kill a specific shrimp at 1,000 ft depth. Except it's more difficult.

Then Newton comes along and spoils the rail-gun. ""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."" The Beijing star-ship would have been thrown backwards with equal force, that is 65 Kilotonne of TNT for each shot. The g-forces involved would be astronomical. Accelerating nukes on a 500 meter rail to 30,000 km/s would make the detonator and the uranium (or californium etc) totally fuse into a slug  never to explode. Maybe the author doesn't know this.

Here is a photo of a rail-gun used in US Navy for experimental purpose. https://goo.gl/8Q5BJe The bullets can reach a speed of 3 km/s. Look at the cabling!

The rail-gun on Beijing needs 100,000+ times more power for every shot fired, than the US Navy's current gun. The slug would be accelerating on the rail-gun for 1/10,000 of a sec, then it would be in free fall, no more acceleration, the gun has way too short barrel. But suppose the rail-gun was long enough (like 10,000 times longer), the energy it takes to accelerate one shot is like a 65 kilotonne nuclear bomb. Not even Superman, Harry Potter and Gandalf can do that together.

It's like a story where the hero shoots down jet-fighters with his .38 service gun and then sinks a supercarrier with an M60 machine gun. If you don't know what a gun is then the story will work just fine, else not.

Little science, mostly scientism involved (scientism is language that is using scientific words to appear like science).

And it's always interesting to see how different authors pull off a First Contact story, as there are many different ways a first encounter with extraterrestrial life can go.  So I started Lacuna with... not exactly sky-high hopes, but with the expectation to find an entertaining story.

Sadly, ""Lacuna's"" flaws outnumber its strengths to such a degree that, while I can't count it as among the worst sci-fi books I've ever read, nor can I recommend it.  It starts out with some promise, but soon degenerates into a mess.

""Lacuna"" follows the story of Melissa Liao, an officer in the Chinese military who counts herself as one of the survivors of a devastating alien attack on Beijing... an attack that takes fifty million lives.  Identical attacks take place in Tehran, Iran and in Sydney, Australia, and all are accompanied by the same cryptic message -- ""never again attempt to develop this kind of technology.""  Humanity's response is not to acquiesce to the aliens, but to build three huge military ships to fight back... and Melissa finds herself helming one of them.  With the aid of James Gregoire, the handsome Belgian captain of another starship, and Summer Rowe, a hyperactive and foul-mouthed computer nerd, Melissa sets out to defend Earth from the alien onslaught... but when she finally comes face to face with the enemy, she finds they have far more in common than they realized, and that the aliens have devastating plans for humanity...

The writing of this book is... okay.  It's not terrible, but neither is it very good.  It reads in a workmanlike manner, serviceable but not particularly memorable.  I didn't find any major spelling or grammar errors, or at least none severe enough to jar me out of reading.  The author does really seem to like the F-word, however, and while I can put up with it in moderation (I love ""The Martian"" and ""That Bear Ate My Pants"" despite both authors using the F-word periodically), but here it's used so often that it ceases to even be shocking, which is a problem in my book.

The characters are, quite frankly, either very bland or thoroughly unlikable.  I can put up with unlikable characters in fiction when it serves the purpose of the story, but when we're expected to cheer for or identify with said unlikable character, it gets tiresome.  Melissa is, to put it politely, a witch, and while I understand a military officer can't exactly be soft and friendly, it seemed the harsh and angry side of her was all there was.  (On a minor note, the story about how she came to have a more Western name despite being born and raised in China comes across as forced and unbelievable.)  Gregoire, the obvious love interest, is an utterly-bland character who feels like he stepped out of the pages of a Harlequin romance novel, and Summer... the author was probably trying to appeal to his nerd readers with her, but I wanted to slap her.  She was obnoxious, foul-mouthed, utterly disrespectful (I can't believe she could get away with most of her behavior aboard a military vessel, even as a civilian), and constantly wedging references to ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" and the ""XKCD"" webcomic (!) into her conversation at every opportunity.  It was as if the author was beating the reader over the head with this character, going ""See, she's a geek, love her!""  Sorry, it takes more than nerd quotes to win this nerd over.  (For the record, not even the most hardcore nerds are going to put ""Han Shot First"" on their tombstone, and quite frankly, that joke was old a decade ago.)

The plot might have saved the book, but what could have been an interesting exploration of human/alien interaction soon becomes a generic ""Earth vs. Aliens"" plot.  At first the novel seems like it will be more complex than just ""evil aliens out to destroy us,"" with the aliens having a legitimately good reason for wanting humanity to stop developing a certain type of technology (though the way the story is presented, our technological development is apparently more important than avoiding the destruction of the universe).  But it doesn't take long for the aliens to simply want to wipe out humanity just to be evil -- the aliens even gloat about shedding human blood and torturing Melissa for kicks.  And while we do see at least one sympathetic alien, I find it hard to believe that said sympathetic alien would betray her kind so easily for humanity's sake, and feel no remorse for doing so.  Every other alien that shows up is either cannon fodder or a cackling '80s cartoon villain.

SPOILER ALERT:  Also regarding the aliens -- while the scientists maintain their biology is ""like nothing I've ever seen,"" said aliens are essentially just cat people.  I'm not even joking, they're literally described as cat people.  I'm not asking for ""gray aliens"" or for something completely bizarre, but it's just hard to take the aliens at all seriously when they're literally just humanoid cats.

I don't think this book deserves one star, as I think the author has a lot of potential and some fascinating ideas, and while his prose was fairly bland, he at least knows his technical writing skills and the writing didn't make my eyes bleed.  But all the same, the story feels like a mess, and I can't bring myself to keep reading the series or to recommend it to anyone else.  Better luck next time, Mr. Adams...","Promising First Contact story becomes generic ""evil aliens"" plot",3,7/20/2016
630,3,A1FIRSBLE8NZIF,B006RZNR3Y,"Without warning, Earth  is attacked by an alien species. They destroy three cities, leave a garbled message, and then leave.

Fast forward a few years and Earth has completed building three new  ships on the moon, ships designed to take the fight to their enemy should they come back. The Shangai is captained by Melissa Liao and during trials out near Saturn, the enemy returns. Captain Liao decides to confront them and in the process, destroys the enemy ship and captures one of the aliens alive.

The writing is fine and decently paced. Overall I liked the idea of the story but it's the execution I have a problem with. Captain Liao is utterly unlikable. I don't mean that in the way you don't like the bad guy because it's the bad guy, I mean there's nothing likable about this character.

You've also got to deal with a scientist/engineer who curses every other sentence for no reason whatsoever and seemingly has no regard for advanced technology. In one scene, she demonstrates an alien sidearm by shooting the bulkhead, causing it to melt, then she casually tosses the weapon aside. It's not believable.

The there's a pissing match between a petty, jealous former executive officer who, somehow commits mutiny in an attempt to commandeer two ships. Now, everybody on board these two ships knows there is a captured alien, but somehow nobody knows that this officer was relived of duty and sent to the brig.

It concerns a US marine who is now too crippled to do his active job and is sought out to be part of a new kind of 'police' activity. Others have expressed this better in the reviews, so I'll just add a couple of problems. The Florida Keys are misspelled 'Keyes'. '14' colonies are mentioned instead of 13, and the time sense is messed up a couple of times. Although taking place in the period 1814-16 (and on), there seems to be confusion that British soldiers are still present in the colonies. Also, the almost 200 year ago period is sometimes presented as being much longer ago. Finally, 'poured over' a map should be 'pored over'.

642,3,A396UH172DTU4P,B006WB4W2I,"This is the real life story of American POW told largely in his his own words through his letters home. The narrator steps in between the letters to provide continuity and context.  This approach could work, but the narrator is too intrusive, and her tone is annoying.

For instance, she says, ""This, dear reader, is what Don describes of his experience as a prisoner at Stalag VIIA."". That is patronizing.  We already know what he described because we just read it in his letter.  Besides that, the whole ""dear reader"" thing is annoying and steps all over the story.  It is a narrative style from the 1800s, and it should stay there.

Not content to merely narrate, she feels compelled to preach.  ""Thus imagine yourself at Stalag VIIA in March 1945.""  She needs to just tell the story, and allow us to experience it on our own.

Then there are omitted words, extraneous words, run on sentences, and sentence fragments.  Awkward sentences abound.  ""They could not sit up in their bunks, and very poor lighting.""  That doesn't work, but it is typical.  Here is another one.  ""Because it was so cold and little food and space, basically the men stayed in bed most of the time.""

It is great that this story has been preserved for the world and for Don's family.  I can tell this was a labor of love.  However, it needs a good editor who is a native English speaker to make it a stronger, more coherent story.","Interesting enough, but....",2,10/28/2016

But if you give it a chance, what a story! It puts other Man vs Nature stories to shame. Hemingway puts you in the boat with this old man, and watch his fortunes rise and fall, and how he copes with physical and mental pain, alone and far from shore.

648,5,A2YXRT2XIJIO57,B006YGE4NS,"Ive read the majority of Hemingways works, almost all of them when I was in my teens and 20s. I am now in the process of re-reading a number of them, including this finely crafted novella, which was a contributing factor in Hemingway being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. Particularly this work, after almost a half a century, resonate all the more, now that you can feel some of the old mans pains, and you are much more conscious how you have to use your knowledge and experience to overcome the declining strength of ones body. A high school student really cannot truly understand.

The old man is Cuban, whose wife has died, and he lives in a shack, alone, along the beach, still practicing the only real profession he has ever known: being a fisherman. A young boy has adopted him, and provides moral and physical support to alleviate his poverty.  The old man has had his glory days, sailing as far away as Africa, where he saw the lions on the beach. He also had immense strength in his youth, beating an opponent in a hand-wrestling contest that lasted all night.

The heart of the novella is when the Old Man grabbed the Brass Ring, hooking the largest fish ever, a marlin that is two feet longer that his 16 foot skiff. It is truly an epic struggle to reel the marlin in  and the old man fishing experience allows him to think like a fish, knowing instinctively the most likely tactics the fish will use. The old man also instinctively knows  long before the days of GPS and weather forecasts, where he is, and what weather will be forthcoming. Even with all his experience, he rues how unprepared he is, in terms of the omission of certain equipment from his boat, for such a multi-day struggle with The Big One of his life. He can still summon forth some of his youths strength, along with his cunning, in order to prevail.

Victory though is bittersweet, as it so often is. On more than one occasion Ive thought that the bleak outcome of this work might have foreshadowed Hemingways decision to commit suicide, at the young age of 61, when so many possibilities still remained.

In terms of high school assignment books, this is one that I fully advocate still being assigned, for many a student should appreciate the straightforward narrative, and the clean-cut epic struggle, even though today they might never have heard of Joe DiMaggio, or known that the Dodgers were once in Brooklyn. But if you read it in high school today, please make a modest commitment to read it a half century later, and undertake the steps to improve your chances of making it that half century. For your understanding of it, the second time around, might easily be 3 x that of your youth. 5-stars.",A late in life struggle,29,5/13/2016

I loved this story, it was a lot of feelings and every character had issues that gripped your heart and squeezed it.

The writing style is good with lots of dialogues but also some internal dialogues that made the story even sweeter. I loved when Shane really reflected on a friends problem and came to a conclusion that seemed rather good and mature.

The relationship between Shane and Trey grows slowly(don't tell me you didn't understand there would be a relationship, it's not a spoiler) and I thought it was sweet in the build up.

668,4,A3PZJIKCYWM85W,B0070FDJPG,"I gave this book 3.5 stars but rounded up since Amazon doesn't do half stars....yet.

First off, I didn't get the Enemies to Lovers theme.  They were never enemies, if anything they were just avoiding of each other.  Just because he gave him a wedgie one time years ago doesnt make them enemies. It just makes Trey a bit of a dick.

The major them of this book seemed to be forgiveness.  I enjoyed it.  I could have done without so much detailed sex.  I know right, I never say that. I get it they are experimenting, but I don't need a play by play for every single time.  Mix it up a bit, throw in a fade to black scene, variety is the spice of life and all that jazz.

Trey was just the cutest, shyest guy.  He tried to fight his attraction, but in the end finally gave in to his feelings.  Shane didn't seem to know what to do about his growing feelings and he was rightly conflicted when it came to acting on them.

I thoroughly enjoyed the toothpaste scene. It was so funny and something I have done with my husband. And the scene when June and Shane had an honest talk about their father and their relationship with Trey.  It was very realistic and emotional for me.

It didn't seem that there was a real climax either.  More like a bunch of little ones. Bottom line, the book was decent, will I read the rest in the series, Mmmmm probably not till next year at least.",It was decent.,2,3/7/2016

Very poorly written book.,Horrible!,2,12/12/2016
670,1,A16WBOMWK2GERJ,B0070DZI70,"First of all, I DNF.  I think this is the first book that I haven't finished (Possibly 2nd).  I usually try to finish a book, no matter what.  I just couldn't this time.  I made it 65% of the way, and just couldn't go on.  I'm sorry to the author, I appreciate that you released it for free, I appreciate that it takes bravery to release your work to the public, but I just really hated this book.  The premise of the book wasn't bad, but the execution was terrible... to the point that it seemed naive and almost like it was written as a high school project by someone who had very little (or no) experience with dating or romance.

The h was irritating, weak, and whiny.  Both H's had traits that made them unlikable.  One breaks up with her after 4 years for basically no reason (& starts dating anther woman a month after, but claims to love her deeply), the other throws tantrums and hissy fits (or completely ignores her) when things don't go his way.  I can't imagine why any woman would want either of them.

Characters were boring and one dimensional.  All of the characters seemed like they were the same person, it didn't matter if they were male or female, they all had the same irritating and boring personality and all of them spoke in a formal manner that made it completely unrealistic.  Writing can and should be formal, EXCEPT when displaying speech on the characters parts.  No one speaks formally like that, let alone eeeveryone in the entire book.

The relationship between the h&H was way too 'over the top' and the h's relationship with  the H's family was even more so 'over the top'.  Everyone got alone perfectly, loved each other instantly, and behaved as though they were family and best friends immediately upon meeting one another.  Very unrealistic.

I just couldn't go on reading, I was bored, and more importantly, I didn't give a *&^% what happened to any of the characters or the story, definitely not enough to continue torturing myself with reading this.

I liked that we were able to see the impact of Karl's bullying from the first book, on both characters, in this one.  I also loved that Paul struggled with his sexuality because of his experiences being an outcast due to his stutter and never wanting to feel that again.  Additionally, Paul's marriage wasn't explained away as a lie, but rather, as a sincere effort to love a woman that he truly cared for.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let me begin.

Where to begin, though?
One, if you are wanting a story that just promises sexual tension and sex, shifter sex, well, you have come to the right place, because this novella is laced with it all. It instantly starts off with Lily and Kieran having an intense sexual tension stare off and then abrupt halt once they get to ""talkin"" by her friend/pack mate Sara. Then there's some rogue issues and that ultimately didn't go nowhere. I guess the author wanted to show that Lily is getting her Guardian mojo back, that led to utter disappointment, because really nothing got resolved. At the end of the novella, I was left wondering, ""When are we going to get back to that? Am I going to have to buy the next installment to find out?"" I don't like when I'm teased with something and there is no follow through making me guess if it's going to happen in the next installment. It pretty much a way to trap me in to wanting to get the next installment. I don't play that. No'mam. Essentially, it was about a one night stand that could lead to more more. If that is what you are looking for then be my guest. Yep. That's all I can say about this novella.",The Long and Short of It: Shifter Sex/Sexual Tension,3,7/6/2016

678,5,A3TBDNLHKQM65W,B0071DLTTK,"I stumbled upon the '1800 Club' series via the onscreen list that appears (scroll down from your current selection) titled 'Inspired by your Browsing History.'  That algorithm works pretty good sometimes.

I've read Book 1, then subsequently 2 & 3.  I'm just about to start Book 4 and I must say, I'm enjoying this series very much. Yes - it can be a bit nave or adolescent at times. Yes - it's not exactly what you would call gritty. Yes - it certainly isn't 'hard' Sci-Fi. Yes - there are some inaccuracies and logic holes here and there. Yes - I'm wondering if the author must've been on a diet and trying to cut back on his drinking and smoking when writing these, because the characters are always tucking in to great dinners and then relaxing with old brandy and fine cigars.

But you know what? It just doesn't matter! These are extremely entertaining. If you're a Time Travel junkie, as I am, then let go of some of your perhaps ingrained preconceptions and just go with the flow. They're really a lot of fun.

And (maybe the best recommendation I could give)... I'd sure like to be one of those guys.

Update to review:

I'm currently up to Book 10. These are quick, easy reads. Ive enjoyed them very much. The authors penchant for describing in great detail his characters period-correct clothing and for reciting the entire (!) menu presented at any of the meals they partake of is, indeed, of great interest - for a while. Its the details that help the reader follow along with the characters wonder and excitement at actually being able to experience the very time periods in which they feel so attracted to.

Perhaps the charm of the series is wearing thin, but Im beginning to get a little fed up with the sameness of the stories. I totally understand if the author chooses to not start mutating the books into strange directions, just because he might feel pressured to. He may well like them just the way they are and doesnt feel the need to shake things up! But, yes, I would like just a smidgeon more intricacy",Great fun for TT junkies,2,3/8/2017

680,1,A1ZVB7606XYYGQ,B0071OU90O,"The writing is well done but the political bias is too much to take. With Kindle unlimited I read a lot of books. I like SciFi and love a series. And writing is a lot of work. But having a well educated and diverse group of reviewers is essential. What made this unreadable by the half-way mark for me is the projection of American right-wing political mythology onto other countries' peoples. When the world needs to pull together there will be some shortages and some nut cases working their crazy conspiracy theories. But economics isn't a zero sum game. Having to build a response to aliens showing up on Mars doesn't mean that doctors and nurses will stop doing their jobs. And Switzerland's Nat'l Healthcare is modeled after Germany's. Everyone has to buy private insurance, insurance companies have to insure anyone who asks, insurance companies can't gouge customers, and pharmaceutical companies can't charge higher prices than in other developed countries like they do with consumers in the U.S.  France also isn't going to stop providing national healthcare because they have agreed to support the war effort. Especially when it is just beginning with construction of the first Frigate in what is to be 3 carriers with a couple of frigates and cruisers each. Nor is the language of Quebec so offensive in France that it would eclipse the dialectic differences within different French-speaking regions in the area, especially when immigrants living in France are included.

Building a fleet would entail spending but also jobs, purchasing materials, shipping, etc. With a worldwide effort likely more people would have jobs and be working harder at them. Not the right-wing mythology that any little stress and EU economies would fall apart because they care for their citizens better than crony capitalism does in the US and 3rd world countries. Really, Swiss Insurers are going to stop paying for necessary eye surgery or the surgeons are going to stop working because the Swiss agree to pay their share based on GDP of protecting the world? Or France will be forced to drop national healthcare causing riots for the same reason? Thus requiring the UN to intercede in France using Swiss and Canadian troops? Who shoot unarmed civilians provoking anti-UN conspirators in the US?

In fact I would have given it 5 stars, it got 4 not in anyway related to the quality of the writing, character development, world-building or any other part of the creation of the book.  I gave it 4 stars simply because the author did not manage to kill a few of the characters whom in my humble opinion needed to be killed like 2 pages after they were introduced.  I plan to read the rest of this series; because the author has me hooked, I absolutely have to know what happens next to Lt. Black, Starr and the rest.  My hope is that Capt. Dickerson (aptly named) gets captured, and then tortured slowly (and I mean extremely slowly) and painfully to death.  He already deserves such just from his actions in this first book.  If he continues to act the same way in the next...  then he needs to be captured on page one and held and tortured till dying at the end of the book.  I can honestly say I don't think I have ever truly hated a character in any book I have read.  But it has finally happened, his behaviour makes me see red.  The author is very good at conveying the pain that the Captain inflicts on others, so well that it is a case of reading about it I feel it.  This is not a comfortable thing, though very much a necessary thing.  The characters in this book very quickly became very real people to me especially Black and Starr.  The story was multi-layers as was the world it is set in.

683,1,A2FZ2I2TZJM1NJ,B007232VP0,"A warning for people who don't want to read certain things.  This series contains rape scenes and/or sexual manipulation (rape).  Just giving you a heads up.

I want to first let it be known that I really like this author.  I also really liked this book!  Here is why I really hate this book without giving any spoilers.  This author has created a world with psypaths and in this world, the ""normal"" people want to essentially get rid of them.  Its a world of normals against psypaths.  She introduces Black (one of the main characters) and he is made out to be a good leader, fearless, and without giving too much information, a great tactician, and very powerful in his own right.  Yet, the author allows this individual to be gullible, bullied, and the most manipulated person ever.  Its a contradiction that becomes more apparent as the books go along.  So far there are 9 of them.  I'm currently reading number 8.  It's so bad what Black will allow people to do to him that its CRAZY!  (When I say ""allow"", trust me, Black has to let people do it for them to do it!)  It's all in the name of keeping ""loved ones safe"" but its getting ridiculous.  One person is manipulating him one way for one reason with a particular threat and another person is coming in another way with another and very different threat, but the latter wants him to endanger the love of his life in exchange for endangering others.  Can books have a limit to how many bad guys there are because this book is reaching the limit...here is all of the people who are either bad guys and/or manipulating Black by book 8.

1.  Silent city (trying to manipulate)
2.  Captain Dickerson (manipulate by threatening everyone and everything.  If it were up to him, he would burn the city down and everyone in it to keep Black on a puppet string and Black is letting him.  The amazing part is his wife doesn't see this blantant characteristic in him and thinks he's fine.  She loves Black like a mother but doesn't see anything.  And just to let you know how depraved Captain Dick is, in book 8 without going into detail, he takes control of Black's mind and forces him to suck multiple men off and kill a fellow officer just to show how he can control Black.  And before this happens, Black is standing around letting them do this WHEN HE IS CAPABLE TO GET OUT.
3.  Lieutenant of BC1 (he is just out for himself)
4.  Lieutenant Kard (the current manipulator who is threatening Black's love of his life and threatening everyone else.  He is threatening to make Black go and blow up psypaths homes with them in it and I'm sure Black is going to remain the puppet to go along and do it!  All in the name of protecting his loved ones!)
5.  Genisus (just a bad guy but you have to try to figure out if he is wanting to kill Black or gain him as a lover.  It develops in other books and yet another instance where the author isn't consistent.  Sometimes he wants to destroy Black, sometimes he wants to rule the city with Black.  It goes back and forth)
6.  JC1 (They are in competition with JC2 and they hate JC2.  It's surprising that you would see this in a police force.  No, they aren't in actual competition but they aren't on the same team.  They hate JC2 and Black is JC2 so they want Black to fail.)

Do you see my point?  There are so many individuals who are perfectly fine to go and kill and/or blow up peoples homes and most are on the police force and expect to not get caught.  It can be only one of these reasons:  1) the police force really really suck and don't actually do their jobs, 2) they are just bluffing which just makes Black once more gullible and lets people manipulate him.

Like I said, I'm currently reading book 8.  These books are like a soap opera.  They seem to have a lot happening, but you get to the end of the book and find that not much has happened.  Bad guy still isn't caught and they have another cliff hanger that takes you into another book.  In all of the eight books, there hasn't been a single bad guy caught and taken care of and the good guys are all having terrible things happen to them.

The reason I really really hate these books???  Even though they are driving me crazy and I'm really pissed off with the author and the direction the books are going, I can't seem to stop.  I want to, but I'm now invested.  I would tell you they are well written, but the author needs to work on plots and character development.  After I finish 8 and 9 I'm going to stop following the author and I won't look for future books.  (I have unlimited reading through Amazon and these books are on the list.  It's the only reason I'm still reading them since I don't have to buy them.  If I had to buy them, I would've stopped a LONG time ago.)  I'm not the only one who feels this way.

I loved all the characters, the heroes and the villains alike. I actually grew quite attached to the wolves and was a little disappointed that their elaborate scam wasn't paying off in the end! This book even though it is so short it manages some great morals for children. It teaches that crime doesn't pay, don't talk to strangers, don't steal and don't scam people!

Cons: I have no issues with this book.

689,4,A247M2SSLKTSHY,B0074QXD5C,"An entertaining novel with endearing small-town, eccentric characters, whose shared past histories provide a lot of their interaction outside of the actual mystery.  The two main characters might well be geriatric versions of Stephanie Plum and her sidekick, Lulu.  The book was basically well-written with only a few of the tiniest errors in grammar and punctuation--nothing to really detract from the story itself.  A pleasant way to spend a few hours in light reading.  However, I hope future editions will clean up the terrible mess of Kindle formatting errors.  It's nice that the author knows how to use a hyphen (so many don't), but in the first three chapters alone I counted 16 hyphens that were replaced by an odd little question mark in a box.  Throughout the book, the font size of the text suddenly switched from my setting to a giant font, too. The formatting errors really detracted from the reading experience.","Pleasant, Light Reading But Major Formatting Errors",2,11/27/2016

Hearing the call from the sheriff, he wheels his horse to escape the men only to have their leader throw an axe into his back.  Though taken to a monastery in hopes that the monks might save his life, he succumbs to his wounds, leaving Lady Allyene with only the young under sheriff to protect her. She assumes that the Lord of the neighboring lands has set his men to kill her father but no evidence can be found of this, the lord remains away at war. When the sheriff and his men cannot find the men who attacked her father, she resorts to seeking the young knight that she's always envisioned herself marrying. Morning her father and wanting to assure the safety of her people, but without enough trained men to guarantee the safety of her home, she sends for the knight and his men.

695,4,A9UG81EGN9XAR,B0077EOE2C,"I have read all eight books (so far) in the series.

The good points: The author has a great story well suited to serialisation, and keeps the interest up.  The author also has a particular political outlook, but does not propagandise. It is plausible within the world that has been created. This is a very hard thing to do, and very few actually succeed, so well done.  It also has a great range of characters.

The bad: Since there are eight books, there's a lot of back story going on.  As mentioned above, much of the story revolves around a particular political point of view. Repeating that is a negative, since it is understandable and plausible (even if the philosophy isn't mine, I can still see it as feasible in his world) from book 1, having it repeated so that readers who haven't read all the stories can 'get it' just makes me page flick.

698,5,AU5MPGZYJL31G,B0078S9B6G,"This book takes a few pages to ease into, but once you do...you're hooked. This is a fish out of water story of a young man who travels back in time almost sixty years and adapts to a new life. It also a love story, and a very sweet and romantic one at that, told against the back drop of America's entry into WW II.

This is my second Heldt book, the first being the Journey and the time travel theme is a recurring one. Heldt handles it very well and you never feel you've stumbled into a scifi fantasy. Rather, it is a character driven tale following young Joel- the time traveler, as he begins to establish himself in this new era.

He falls in love with a girl who is engaged to be married and another example of Heldt's skill is the handling of the attraction between the new lovers and pain their relationship will cause her fiance, a young soldier about to leave for the war. Heldt manages to avoid a lot of cliches here and this is a highlight of the book.

A comment on characterization. The characters walk off the page very easily- meaning you can identify with them when you were at that point in your life. The strength of this aspect of the book is that you continue to think about them after you've finished their story. Something that writers rarely accomplish.

I've used the word 'sweet' to describe this tale. Let me elaborate a bit so you won't run for the exit. This book approaches love from an idealistic vantage point, perhaps somewhat representing mid-twentieth century values, but in a way where people don't just jump into bed for physical fulfillment. That's what i mean. So there aren't any graphic sex scenes depicted. Relationships are explored and evaluated for long term potential before taking a carnal step. Sweet may not be the word, but it's what occurred to me.

Mostly a linear tale with a couple of neat twists at the end as Joel has to decide whether to continue his new life in the past or return to his present when the opportunity suddenly comes along.

Finally, I want to say the ending is handled masterfully and is very satisfying to the romantically inclined reader. Major congrats to Heldt for avoiding cliches here.

All in all, a very readable and sweet tale of young love. You really can't do better than this one. I bought the next book in this series immediately upon finishing this one. No higher praise can be tendered.",A sweet tale of young love with a time travel hook,2,9/12/2017

I could barely see through the tears reading the last two pages - and the final twist I did NOT see coming.  This book is brilliantly written!  I must say that it wasn't anything like I had pictured. I downloaded the book for free because one of the keywords was WWII and I love WWII romances.  It starts out a little rough, in the present (or at least in the year 2000), but hang on until he goes back. The trip is well worth it. Many times it gave me the feel of one of my fav movies, Casablanca.  I loved Joel by the third chapter and loved him throughout, but I felt toward him as a brother, lol. It was like I was watching my brother find the love of his life, lol.  That's a good thing. ;)  At first, the book showcases four different college age girls and I couldn't figure out which one he would fall for.  Once his grandmother was singled out, that left the other three and for a while, the author keeps us in suspense. Then we realize who Joel loves, but what in the world would happen next, I hadn't a clue.  The book kept me guessing throughout.  I was afraid it would be a copy of Back to the Future, you know, silly and ridiculous, but it's not. Oh, it has funny moments and clever dialogue, but the fact that Joel is experiencing life in 1941 matures him in a way nothing else could. It also was a wonderful look at the differences and yet similarities to life then vs. now. In many ways, this is a beautiful book, with a solid character story and plot.  It's well worth your time.

 If you're looking for a love story, it truly is one, although from the cover I couldn't tell and I let it languish on my kindle for 3 months before I took the plunge.  That would be my only complaint. I wish the cover reflected more of what happens rather than just his stumbling upon the temporary doorway to the past.  There's no sex but there are a few instances of profanity, so I can't say it's a clean romance, but it's close.

700,5,A1KTI9YNBYR1TU,B0078S9B6G,"Have you ever finished a book and just had to sit there in silence for a few moments and just soak it all in? The beautiful writing, the passionate romance, and the gut wrenching decisions the characters made? That is how I felt when I finished The Mine. I put down my kindle and just sat there for a few minutes. I had to soak it all in. I was so sad that it was over, but so happy to have experienced the story.

Joel started out as somewhat of a typical frat guy. He has a kind-of girlfriend and has spent his college career enjoying himself, along with earning a degree in geology. The experiences he has in 1941 shape him into an adult, rather than a college kid. When Joel arrives in 1941, he has to fend for himself and find a way to survive when he has nothing except a couple of quarters. He uses his wits to get himself from Helena, Montana to Seattle, Washington. Once in Seattle, he makes friends with Tom and through Tom he becomes friends with a group of girls, including his future grandmother, Ginny. Joel finds a job and living arrangements and a new family in 1941.

The historical aspects of this novel are so interesting. Joel travelled to May, 1941, just a few short months before the attack on Pearl Harbor and the US entering World War II. Joel knows what is coming, including the fate of his new friend, Tom, but he cant tell anyone. No one would believe him even if he did tell someone. But its a struggle to let fate take its course. The 1940s world that John Heldt weaves is so clear, I felt like I time travelled along with Joel. I particularly love when the characters go to see Citizen Kane in its first run.

Above all the other aspects of this novel, however, the love story is by far the best part. I am a sucker for a good love story and this one was so sweet without being cheesy. Joel and Grace are so good together and really bring out the best qualities in each other.

Everything else that I want to say about this novel contains more spoilers than I want to give, so I will just leave it with this: read this book. If you enjoy historical fiction and romance with just a splash of science fiction, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. I cant wait to read the next installment in the Northwest Passage series!

702,5,A345U10UP0S8LR,B0078S9B6G,"I am a bit of a sucker for the fantasy of time-travel tales. It is interesting to see the different time vortexes (eg jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, using a special watch, and walking down special steps at the right time etc.), the different reactions to moving to another time period and the problems of whether to return home (if they can), and should they do things that might affect the course of history. With THE MINE John Heldt has started off a series of time-travel tales that are well written, and cleverly plotted to make the most of this fantasy genre.

In 2000 Joel Smith is a confident and adventurous college senior with no worries in the world. One day during a trip to Montana he sees a TV news item about a very rare significant planetary conjunction.  Soon after, following his keen interest in geology he breaks into a boarded-up abandoned mine, passes through a glowing passageway and when he comes out he finds himself in mid-1941, a time only a few months away from Pearl Harbour in days of swing music and a peacetime draft in anticipation of war.

After the initial shock of finding himself in the past, Joel quickly finds his way back to his hometown of Seattle by jumping a freight train. Down on his luck with no money, hungry and tired he helps an apparently rich young man, Tom, from being mugged. Tom takes him home and lets him live in a trailer in the garden. He also introduces him to his girlfriend Ginnie a lovely free-spirited young girl of 21. How would you react to meeting your beloved Grandmother in her youth?

Joel slowly settles down to life in the 1940's, becomes a star salesman in Tom's father's furniture store and makes a lot of money carefully betting on sporting events where he knows the outcome. He makes many friends, especially among Ginnie's circle of beautiful independent-minded young females. Then Joel meets Grace..... But then Pearl Harbour is just around the corner and the rare confluence of planets is about to happen again that may give him a chance to go back to where he belongs.

John Heldt is a great storyteller and seems to have had a lot of fun putting together a bunch of great characters in an unusual setting. I thoroughly enjoyed this fairly short, well-written, entertaining tale with frequently tender (but not explicit) relationships.

There WAS stuff I liked about this book, but ultimately I think it's suffered from improper billing, both public and artistic. I first heard of this book as a kind of meta-narrative, of Star Trek redshirts figuring out their expendable nature and trying to change their narrative around that. And yes, the book works on that level, to an extent, but just when I grew weary of the codas at the end, and the last few chapters in general, Scalzi pulled a fast one and made this book ultimately about choice and fate, something almost Pirandello-like, though a good majority of the book seems to put aside such considerations for a lot of expositional dialogue and occasional wit, which is what wore me down in the first place.

But when I signed up for World Without Ends 12 Awards in 12 Months Reading Challenge, I tried the free first 4 chapters and liked it enough to get the book.  So glad that I did.

The complete quote mentioned above (from the books acknowledgements) is: readers whoassured me that the thing was something more than just a piss-take on televised science fiction (although obviously it is that too). This is absolutely accurate.  Yes the central novel does have an interesting- and often hilarious- take on all of those doomed Star Trek crewmen from their point of view.  But it is also old fashioned sci fi with alternate universes and questions of reality.  The reference to codas in the title is a little misleading.  It is much closer to a novel with three short stories with the three stories focusing on minor characters from the novel covering topics from writers block to the choices we make in life. I enjoyed them at least as much as the core novel.

712,5,A2XPDUGXNGGRAI,B0079XPUOW,"Another humor-sci-fi hit out-of-the-ballpark by John Scalzi; he certainly is a master of this genre.

So what would happen if the Redshirts in the typical television quest sci-fi show were self-aware enough of the danger? How would a group of scientists and explorers overcome the issue of being a ""Redshirt""? Investigate and resolve.

Story got a little too Meta in chapter 23 and the final bit with the end of chapter 23 and start of 24 fell flat to me.

The first time I read the Three Codas - where we return to ""modern"" times and follow the lives of the people impacted by the Redshirts time travel visit was a struggle. I disliked the staggered ending. When I re-read it now, I actually enjoyed the three Codas - first off for giving us more about the people impacted by the visit. Second for the writing exercise the Codas represent - the first Coda is written in first person, the second Coda is written in second person and the third in third person. If someone is having problems with POV definition, reading these three Codas might help. I don't think it will help them write in the different POV, but it will help them understand what they are - the ""I"", ""you"" and ""s/he"".

In conclusion, funny, funny story for the most post. The ending, starting about chapter 21, in the first read-thru annoyed me - felt weak - and I got a little lost. The second read-thru about 3 years later, I enjoyed the beginning just as much as the first time and the ending felt much better. I ""got"" it. Still not as funny as the main part of the book and that last bit of chapter 23 annoys me, but does provide good resolution.  Overall a 4.5.

714,4,ACFLHDXCQZ01K,B007AUY1EE,"Backtrack is a different type of time travel story, and as such, it can prove to be a challenge for the reader to keep track of where and when the story is occurring. It is fast-paced, and keeps your interest well. Just try not to be too picky on the time period something is happening, because it will almost assuredly change.

The challenge found in the book, is that time-travel can only be in one direction - backward. When one thinks about it, that is a logical concept. The thought of time as a single line is a fallacy. The myriad decisions made every instant of every day moves time forward in a way which would be impossible to duplicate; the amount of what must stay the same is beyond comprehension. Consequently, going backward is the only logical possibility. To change some future event, you must first experience it, and only then can you have any possibility of changing it, be it going back ten seconds or ten years.

This book deals in those questions, with a main character who gets thrown into a situation not of his choosing. He ""learns on the job"", so to speak, being tasked by the inventor of the time ring to stop a horrific terrorist attack that is three years in the future. How does he know? He lived through it and has come back to try stopping it. The problem is he is being hunted by some who know of this capability and want to stop it. The inventor passes the ring to the main character and charges him to complete the task.

Some things are almost humorous, such as re-meeting the same person many times due to jumping back; and some things start to drag the story down, such as enduring many jumps just to get something right.

Overall I think it was an excellent book, with some of the main problems being the villains. They seemed to be mostly clueless, except for the one head person. A spy thriller is not as thrilling when the villains never come close to winning. Think about all those books, TV shows and movies where the villains are unloading clip after clip of ammo, and they almost never hit the good guys, while the good guys just pick off who they want.

Can Julie put aside her hurt and see what he wants for her? Can they move beyond the differences and see they are actually made for each other?

I was actually amazed at the character development in this novella. I got a true sense of what made both of them tick. Also, the plot has a new twist that made this a highly enjoyable love story. My only suggestion be would a stronger ending. It felt a bit rushed to me. It has a happily for now ending. Of course, since this is the first book in this series, I suspect Ms. Kevin will have this couples relationship grow in the next book.

Julie Delgado is a great heroine. She is vulnerable but has determined to succeed even though she suffers a lot of disappointments. There is a surprising amount of depth to her character, considering the length of this book.

I fell in love with Andrew Kyle's character. At first, I wasn't sure about him because the first scene in the book does not show him in a favorable light, but once his motives unfold, then it makes sense. He wants Julie to find the full extent of her creative side.

I listened to the audio version, and as always, I thoroughly enjoyed Eva Kaminskys performance. She reads with a great deal of emotion and does a credible job on giving each character a distinct voice.

If you are looking for a light-hearted read with a unique plot and engaging characters, then you will enjoy The Wedding Gift as much as I did. I look forward to reading/listening to the other books in this delightful series. Happy reading!",Great start on another series!,2,3/9/2016

725,4,A28DXG2BDV4CD,B007GSO4XS,"As a fellow ""spinster,"" I rooted for Miss Moseley. I felt her hurt when the man she secretly loved wanted her to find a wife for him. I felt her astonishment when a surprising man started showing romantic interest in her. And, I cheered her along to a satisfying conclusion -- and a happy ending. I didn't even mind her letters to Madeline that were strewn throughout the book. They were a little sad and strange, but they gave more insight into how Miss Moseley was thinking and feeling.

This book gives you everything you'd expect from a Regency Romance -- except for the letter from Madeline at the end. That's what threw me. Without giving too much away, it jolted me out of the sweet Regency period into something entirely different -- the supernatural. Have you ever eaten some delicious, sweet grapes and then bit into a bad one? That letter from Madeline was something like that bad grape for me. It ruined the flavor of the entire book and left me with a strange taste in my mouth.

I understand that the author was probably trying to set the reader up for another book. I get that. However, throwing a supernatural curve ball into a Regency romance is just too jarring. There are other ways outside of the actual story that the author could have introduced her other book.

Anyway, if it wasn't for that letter from Madeline at the end of the book, I would have given ""Miss Moseley The Matchmaker"" a 5-star rating.

Although today they seem just easily laughable and nave, the genius of Marx, transcends through a formidable understanding of the history of economic sociology.

The first part is little more than an emotional rant. The communist manifesto is completely untenable and unrealistic in any practical form. This is evinced since the advent of communism in Russia through every country that touts the communist ideal. This utopian idea, as Marx states himself, can only exist at the behest of a bourgeois already in existence and well developed that a proletariat might be created so that the communist philosophy may become necessary and thereby implemented. The society Marx outlines is devoid of any boundaries, towns, cities, provinces, states, counties, countries, and political parties. From its thrust into the world in Russia throughout every communist country currently in existence, not a single one of them reflects the philosophy and ideology of Marx's communism. All communist regimes are just as much a prime example of class distinction and class antagonism, albeit minus the ""right"" to publicly take any position not in line with the ruling communist class. Marx's philosophy directly opposes not only industrialization but also the advent and continued proliferation of a mechanized world. It is also a philosophy lacking any sense of values and character indemnified by Marx's open declaration that communists will ride on the back of any revolutionary movement they view as having the probability of overthrowing the ruling class of any nation regardless of that revolutionary movement's philosophy.

After reading this the naivety of Marx and his fellow communists of his era, the progenitors of the communist philosophy, it becomes abundantly obvious that power hungry, greedy men of unbounded avarice would see the communist philosophy as a means to their ends with the window of opportunity presently afforded them at the time. These men then used the guise of communist utopia to rally men to their cause, the poorer the better, to agitate them towards violence and ride the wave of revolution to victory and the establishment of yet another government that does not also create class distinction and oppression but brutally does so. Once these men are in power the result is similar to a monarchy without the opulence. Not only all power is invested in the ruling class but also so is all the national wealth held by the ruling class, just like it is in a monarchy.
Boundaries are not erased in any sense but are more firmly established and enforced even at the cost of death for anyone who would try to escape such a blissful existence.

The representative government authorized by a constitution is not, as no construct of men may not be, without its problems. Still, a government defined by the people of a nation, restricted by a constitution, and built upon inherent rights belonging to every human being, is far better than anything else the world had in the past or currently exercises.",A Utopian Manifesto,10,11/30/2017

744,1,A30WJKGX1XG19Q,B007IO7C6Q,"This book just didn't work for me.  Trey a country music superstar and alcoholic and womanizer decides he wants his wife back after being divorced for 5 years because he finds out that she's moving on and marrying someone else.  Sierra never really got over Trey and although she says she can't take him back it sure doesn't take him long to win her back.  In fact it's only a matter of days.

This book had a couple of things I really hate in a book:

1) The author's need to demonize the guy she doesn't stay with.  Why does the fianc have to end up being a horrible person.  (I wish author's didn't feel the need to make us hate the other guy - why can't we sympathize with him).  Sometimes things just don't work out but he doesn't have to be a complete villain.  And to top it all off he couldn't even perform sexually.  I mean really?  I didn't understand the need for the heroine to have not had sex with any one else since the divorce.  Especially since the hero was having sex with tons of women.

2)When they do have sex - no condom even though he was drunk all the time and had sex with a lot of other woman.  He insists he always used a condom (although he was so drunk I'm not sure how he can know this) and she believes him anyway.

3) The heroine gets blamed for the break-up because she kept something back from the hero.  Even though he was an alcoholic, left her alone two weeks after she lost their baby and was basically always out on tour or getting drunk in a bar.  All of a sudden she's to blame and she takes the blame on and feels guilty?  Way too much of a doormat for me.

4) Hero suddenly decides he's going to quit drinking and that's it.  Not really mentioned again except for going to one AA meeting.  As if it would be that simple.

5) The best friend who is his manager is really a JERK!  He doesn't seem to be looking out for his best friend more for his own pocketbook.  He hates the ex-wife and then does a complete 180 at the end with a less than believable explanation.

6) The Hero takes the easy way and lets his actions hurt the heroine.  When Trey's best friend brings the girl he's having sex with to his family's party when he brings his ex-wife Trey does nothing.  The girl throws herself at Trey and kisses him and says something that makes it obvious they are having sex and he does nothing even though his ex is right there and he knows this would hurt her.  Then later he dances with the ""girlfriend"" and even though he's breaking it off he doesn't let his ex know this so it just looks like he's enjoying dancing with the girlfriend.

Honestly, by the end of the book I didn't like Trey and I thought Sierra was a complete push over.  I was going to give this book two stars but after writing this I realize how much I didn't like this book and I'm giving it one star.",Unlikeable Hero and Doormat Heroine,8,3/3/2016

747,3,AW4NFCPN81CS3,B007K3D4CQ,"A CARESS OF WINGS is an e-novella (June 2012 release) in Sylvia Days Renegade Angels series.  Part of the series premise follows that if a Sentinel (Guardian Angel) falls in love or mates with a mortal/human their wings are removed and they become the Fallen.  As a Fallen, they are now vampire, and require blood to survive. But along the way, a few of the Fallen have requested leniency and begged off from vampire status and have become lycan-infused with demon blood with the capability to shift.  The lycans are currently on the run, hoping to escape servitude to the Sentinels.

A CARESS OF WINGS is a short story that follows the rescue of a human male-Trevor Descansos by Sentinel Angel Siobhan.  Trevor had been held prisoner by a horde of virus-infected vampires for over a year.  Tortured, sexually abused and used for his blood, Trevor begged for death. Weak and dying, all he knew was the daily pain and torment of hundreds of hungry mouths biting and clawing for his blood.  But when a beautiful angel freed Trevor from his chains, he knew death had granted his wish.

Siobhan is a researcher for the Sentinels. Knowing their blood was a cure for the vampire virus proved invaluable and dangerous at the same time.  If the vampires knew then every Sentinel would be targeted.  Looking for a cause to the vampire virus, it was one of Siobhans responsibilities to investigate and test new theories surrounding the virus that was quickly overtaking the vampire hordes. But finding a dying Trevor chained to a wall pulled at her heart.  Guilt ate at Siobhan for not finding Trevor sooner, but by infusing his blood with her own, Trevor would soon make a quick physical recovery.  But it was his emotional mind and his memories that would cause bigger problems for the pair, when Trevor and Siobhan begin to develop a strong attraction to each other.

A CARESS OF WINGS is a short story.  Siobhan was previously introduced in an earlier storyline and A Caress of Wings opens a premise into another potential Fallen Angel.  To be honest, in the beginning I had a difficult time connecting to the pair.  Perhaps it is because the Sentinels are without emotions, yet Siobhan most definitely felt something for Trevor. Trevors delirium was well written, but once he was back to health, his personality reminded me of a puppy lost and looking for someone with whom to play.  Also, the premise of The Fallen Angels is technically lost when the current crop of storyline characters does not meet with the same fate as previous Angels who fell.  Perhaps, like real life, the Sentinels have evolved and learned from their mistakes in the past. An interesting storyline, and one that I hope Sylvia continues throughout the series.  Now that a number of Angels are falling for humans, there will have to be a resolution that will satisfy everyone. Looking forward to A Hunger So Wild.",3.5 stars...,2,3/10/2016

I read a lot of romance books, all types, this was a change from those although there was some romance in it. There was also suspense, danger, surprises, lots of characters, the gal Cassidy Christensen doesn't get the names of everyone she calls them descriptive names and they stick, like ""Hot Redhead"" she didn't like that gal, she was annoying and always in the way.  In addition to two hot men pursuing this gal, and some bad men she couldn't seem to shake at times.  There were many characters and they were really all a part of a well woven mystery that came down to Cassidy Christensen's family her Mom and Dad who had been killed.  They were a part of why they had been killed and what they had been doing in Mexico, it wasn't what Cassidy thought they went there to do.
Seems everything that she knew about her family members was all messed up.  Secrets to be revealed when you buy this great book and read it!

I received this book through a drawing I believe the author sent it to me in exchange for an honest review and she knew it would be going to the little library where my Mom volunteers her time when I was done with it.  Two benefits in one!

Running from a scheming redhead intent on making her life miserable. Running from painful memories that sabotage her dreams of happiness. With two very tempting men competing for her attention, she hopes she'll finally have someone to run to, but can she trust either of them? When secrets from her past threaten her family, Cassidy decides to stop running and fight for her future.

So, I will rewrite it briefly this time.
I loved it. Rose captured my heart from the beginning and kept it until the end.
Travis Burnett is a tough, handsome, stubborn, hard, rancher cut in the mold of his daddy. He had his mind set on the perfect wife who didn't exist. Poor Rose, left alone at a tender age, she's now only 21, is simply trying to provide an existence for herself and her loyal manservant/substitute father. He is all she has in the world. So, she she does palm reading and seances- for money. Travis's mother, Eugenia goes to her to find her missing son from the war. He never returned. They, the girls, form a friendship of sorts. Mom hatches a plan.
Rose is the victim.

Rose performs sance to make her way for her dream job. It looks like she picked the wrong women when she started helping Mrs. Burnett whose son isn't happy and calls her a fraud and demands she move to another town. Deciding it is time to move on there is an issue of a missing piece of jewelry and Travis will have nothing of this he goes and gets Rose bring her to the ranch where she will stay until the missing piece is found. Eugenia has decided to play match marker she thinks Rose and Travis make the perfect pair. As she tries to bring these two together Travis isn't having anything to do with it. Why would he want to marry someone who steals from old women, if he was looking for a bride it sure wouldnt be Rose. Rose won't marry anyone who doesnt trust her but Eugenia is having none of this.

Eugenia is a wonderful sweet character that you fall in love with fast. She wants her sons happily married with grandbabies to bounce on her knees and will do anything to make this happen. I loved that Rose and Travis were both strong will people who didn't take any crap it make it a more interesting read. You have two people who are so attracted to each other but neither willing to give in. They sure do put up a good fight but with mother doing her best it isn't easy to walk away. Rose is one feisty lady that takes your heart she isn't afraid to stand on her own two feet not taking any crap she is a strong caring woman who knows her own mind.
Travis is only looking out for his mother and their ranch he will do anything to protect them. There is no way he will let anyone take advanced of his beloved mother. He needs to put some color in his life not everything is black and white. I just adored this over protective man. No doubt about it he is alpha all the way. He stands up for what he believes even if he might be wrong he stands his ground until he is proven wrong.

There is nothing I didn't like about this story the author writes a wonderful story of conflict, passion, truly finding what you need not what you think you want. I love how these two stands up to each other and give as good as they get which makes a very interesting reading. I found this to be a humorous read laughing as Rose swearing at Travis in French than has to translate to tell him what she called him. This was a well written story that entertains the reader giving you a book you cannot put down. It isn't a read that you want to start late at night or you will be staying up late to finish it. I adored this plot and cannot wait to read more in this series. I love audios and I see the author has a few I might just have to pick those up.

If you are looking for a romance that keeps the characters on their toes, full of humor, with strong characters that have no trouble standing up saying what they think why pushing the line with a pushy mother who wants to see her family happy this is the book for you. This is one author that knows how to keep her readers invested as she spins a tale of that takes you away wishing you could be part of this family. I know you will enjoy this as much as I have and will want to read the rest of the series.",Wonderful humorous read that is very entertaining,2,5/14/2016
754,5,A2943E4WX8TZBA,B007PPJOGO,"I recently found this author through Amazon, and I am glad I did.  This book is a fun western romance. Rose is a decent woman trying to make a living during an era when women either were married, or worked as prostitutes.  She is trying to take care of herself and not hurt anyone.  Travis is a rancher who sees everything in black or white.  With the help of his creative, loving mother, and Rose's strong personality, he will find that what he wanted in a woman is not what he needs.  He has met his match in Rose.  She stands up to him and gives as good as she gets.  These characters were so fun to read about.  Rose is so funny when she us swearing at him in French, and she has to translate to tell him what she called him.  This book was not your typical western, with an outlaw out to get the hero or heroine.  It is a funny, romantic story that just happens to take place in Texas in the late 1800's.  I will definitely be reading the next books in this series by this author.",Fun romantic western romp,2,5/13/2016

The story revolves around a rebellious teen who ran away and made life very complicated.  She thought she was winning, but the reality was she was losing herself.

The story, again held a lot of promise, but the delivery is another matter altogether.  There were a lot of typo and grammatical errors in the Kindle edition.  Also, I couldn't imagine how a woman can go from 150 to 60 kg by skipping meals for days, exercising to the extreme, taking laxatives, without so much a hint of physical harm!  I'd thought people who try to lose weight that way died eventually!

I liked Vanessa's grit and intelligence and the fact that Arthur genuinely admired her for those qualities.  He was protective and humorous, and admitted to feeling like a better man when with Vanessa.

I liked Arthur and Vanessa, and I really liked it when the Kellington family was part of the scene because humor surrounds all of their interactions.

It takes on the old system of kings and knighthood while incorporating old legends and creatures to make the novel flow with the medieval feeling you get when reading it. The way DeFillipis uses the thirteen men to start a quest (which I realize thirteen is a commonly used number because of its origins, but nevertheless) reminds me a bit of Chaucer and of J. R. R. Tolkeins novels and the way men were chosen to go out on a mission in order to maintain the worlds balance. I was impressed with the composition of the characters because for having so many, DeFilippis was able to give each character their own unique tag that let you relate to them on some level.

760,4,AUZ3EJAU37NC5,B007SCX46K,"First of all, this is not a novel.  It's a collection of actual newspaper articles written in the 1890s by American journalist Elizabeth Banks (1872-1938), recounting some of her ""undercover"" experiences in Victorian English society.  This was quite the find for me.  It's a fascinating read by a pioneering woman who lived a fascinating life.  (Just google her.  You'll be amazed.  College graduate, then typewriter girl, then society reporter, then secretary at the American Consulate in Peru, then ""stunt journalist"", and, upon her move to London, an investigative journalist for publications such as THE DAILY NEWS, PUNCH, ST. JAMES GAZETTE, LONDON ILLUSTRATED and REFEREE.  She also worked to promote women's suffrage and counted as friends or acquaintances George Bernard Shaw, John Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy, H.G. Wells and suffragette Henrietta Marston.  She made major contributions to British intelligence before and during WWI and worked to draw America into the war.  Well, wow.  Maybe even more admirable than better known journalist Nellie Bly.)

She wrote about the plight of the lower classes and the articles included here are the result of her undercover work as (1) housemaid, (2) street sweeper, (3) Covent Garden flower girl, and (4) laundry girl.  In addition there's a section on the ""Almighty Dollar"" in which she recounts her experiences posing as an American heiress seeking help breaking into upper class society.  She shows how some English aristocrats sold their social influence with only regard for making money.  However, she also exposes the ""shoddiness"" of some of these Americans looking for upward mobility.

When Banks originally set off for England in 1892 (I believe), her parting injunction by her editor was ""Don't forget that you are an American and are going to England simply to compare the inferiorities of that country with the superiorities of your own.""  And, indeed, one of her first articles upon arriving was ""An American Girl's Reply to Mr. Kipling"" printed in response to Kipling's criticisms of America in the Times. That was the beginning of her journalistic career in London.

This collection of articles was originally published as CAMPAIGNS OF CURIOSITY; Journalistic Adventures of an American Girl in London, published in 1894.  In it she relates her adventures and her insights into life as a lower-class working girl.  The articles are a great look at how these women lived and, although not completely unbiased, are a rather fair expose of working conditions and the relationship of upper and lower classes.  This is an informative read, well written with surprising modern writing style, and with some great understated humor.","Undercover investigative reporting in Victorian England.

767,5,A1WQQF1U3Z4FI,B007VO5VAC,"I honestly loved this shortish novel. A lot of reviewers complained about poor editing, but I suspect that, as they were older reviews, I may have received a re-edited copy. I found only an occasional glitch. The story begins with Margaret (Meg) Holstock, a 28 year old bluestocking spinster, who has been given over the care of her 10 year old orphaned nephew Emmett, and his lovable but enormous Mastiff, Perseus. Meg was sister to Emmett's mother, who married his father against his father's family's wishes, which resulted in the family cutting them off. Meg and Emmett travel to Honeysuckle cottage, in the village of Cobbitty, Surrey, that Emmett has inherited. When they arrive, they find the cottage nearly inhabitable, but Meg is determined to make the best of it. Along the way she hires Alice, a village girl who is a wiz at all things domestic, along with her beau, the nearly silent Ned. Meg eventually meets her notorious neighbor, Lucien,
Viscount Chetwyn, while walking in the woods. Chetwyn is an unapologetic rake who lives hard, plays hard, and has frequent debauched parties, when he is in residence. Chetwyn is intrigued by Meg, who isn't the least bit put off by his frankness or his sly innuendos. They continue to meet, and they are drawn together by shared interests and mutual intelligence. The dialogue is sparkling and their relationship progresses in a very natural, realistic way. Eventually Chetwyn, who has a dark past and a terrible reputation, feels that his presence in her life can only be detrimental to her, so he tries to pull away from the only decent relationship he has ever had. ""Things"" happen, and he flees to Italy. Meanwhile, Emmett's paternal aunt and uncle show up to remove him from an ""unsuitable"" situation (read the book to find out why!) and Meg is doubly devastated. Of course there is a HEA, with a lovely epilogue. For those who want to know, there are a few passionate kisses and lustful longings, but any actual sex scenes (near the end of the book) are conducted behind closed doors. All in all, a lovely story.","Lovely story, wonderful dialogue!",5,3/6/2017

I was completely enthralled, and through the dialogue we get to know and love the H and the h. I commend the author; this is clearly her great strength.

One reason is because they are so good you know (even if you're as cheap as I am) that no matter the cost you are going to continue to buy each installment. And then it's so good that you don't stop reading when you should be going to bed because you work a 10 hour shift the next morning.

I had a love/hate relationship with the heroine Amaranthe because she was just so nave and continued to be nave with a big pinch of reckless behavior added to the recipe. Two qualities that together easily made her someone I would want to slap over and over again. But then again because these books were so good of course the most irritating actions led to scenes that made you re-read them just so they could be forever ingrained in your psyche. I don't know if this makes me crazy but...I loved the assassin right away. I knew at the end of book one that he would undoubtedly be my favorite character throughout the series.

I had high hopes but I must say that by book six, it's all I can do to keep reading. Again, the word SNORTED takes center stage. I really don't understand why an author would deliberately overuse one word. That one word, just simply ruined it for me. I am now a little more than half way through Forged in Blood I and it's just getting really tedious and the story is starting to drag. Maybe this is what happens when you find a series after it has concluded rather that reading them one at a time as they are released. I don't know. But the author said she had meant to conclude the series with this book, but the characters just didn't want to go peacefully into the night, so Forged in blood II is next. But, even that didn't seem to finish it up as I see there a couple more after that. In my humble opinion, this story should have been condensed. The parts that were good were really good. Some parts are laugh out loud funny. But there is just too much filler to drag it out. The characters themselves, are very likable and develop well as it goes along. You do find yourself routing for them, but the situations just keep getting sillier and I swear, the whole series was written only to find ways for the characters to wind up naked. Maybe it should've been called the emperor's new clothes. And why are the characters later on in the series suddenly ending their sentences in eh? Are the Turgonians Canadian?

Yes, as others mentioned, the writing style is simple, but the story itself is interesting.  It starts out immediately as a mystery and then more mysteries are layered on top.  The two main characters are Aidan and Jade, who, based on the descriptions in the book, may be the most beautiful, perfect humans who ever lived.  They talk about how beautiful they are a lot and they talk about how other people think they are beautiful a lot. That gets a little boring since it seems the author believes only beautiful and perfect people can be interesting and have strange and mysterious things happen to them.

You'll probably figure out what's going on before the end of the book, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good story.  Strange things are happening and you'll want to know how and why.  The supporting characters are of no great interest (I guess they're not beautiful and perfect enough).

This is a seven-volume series.  I don't think I'll be reading the rest of them, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth reading.  There is an interesting mystery here.

Then she ends up staying for their next job to get money to help save her family farm.  The only problem is that she ends up falling for the hot alpha bank robbers.

So, I loved these three books.  Yes, they have to be read in order to really enjoy them.  This box is a great way to do it.  They were more than I expected.  The covers recently changed and now they have a lighter feel to them which is reflective of the story inside.  Yes, the God Pack boys have dark pasts and there are threats to them, but there are also some very funny moments.  A great series!

Unfortunately it didn't turn out to be the ""original"" story I was expecting. As I began making comparisons to Laurell K. Hamilton's ""Guilty Pleasures"".  These comparisons were not complementary to Nicola Clare's writing style as it appears she heavily copied her characters from Hamilton's series. Examples given below.

Lucinda Monk - (  Mimic of Anita Blake) is a vampire Hunter who is a little more than human and drawn to Michel Durand. She exhibits traits which make her less susceptible to vampire powers but she doesn't know why. Where Anita Blake knows she can raise the dead as a Necroromacer.

Michel Durand Master of the City - (Mimic of Jean-Claude Master of the City. Michel like Jean-Claude is a Master of the City, for the city of Auckland New Zealand. He owns a Night Club called Sensations. He knows the secret to who Luce is. His pet name for her is ""Ma Douce"" you even expect him to say ""Ma Petite""  and he eventually does.

Rick (Mimic of Richard) is Luce's friend and adversary of Michel. Much like Richard's character.

801,1,A6KS9D2K8G56E,B0082CA0Z8,"I saw ""New York Times Bestselling Author"" and made the mistake of assuming this would be readable without first checking the reviews. Big mistake. The review by ReadsTooMuch hits on a few of the things that annoyed me about this book, but there are a few others.

To start with, the entire premise is insane. We're supposed to believe that four of Rhode Island society's wealthiest families have entrusted their daughters and huge wads of cash to a young, unmarried woman they've only known briefly, have no connections to, and who has an uncontrollable temper and a habit of swearing. They expect her to chaperone their daughters to England on a ship full of sailors without maids or any sort of protection, to introduce them to London society (not noticing that she's never been to London before), and find them aristocratic husbands, even though neither she nor they has an appropriate, female, married sponsor who is well enough established to supervise their coming outs. How much cash? A London season in the early Regency period cost at least 5,000 pounds, which (if you're familiar with Pride and Prejudice) was 25% more than the very wealthy Mr. Bingley earned in a year. All this because, in the highly patriotic, anti-British atmosphere of early post-Revolution America, they are utterly dazzled at the thought of a English title.

Despite coming from very well-off, aristocracy idolizing families, on arriving in London these young women were incapable of behaving appropriately in any situation. Apparently, the author was unaware that early 19th century America actually had polite society and that these women would be very familiar with the rules of etiquette. Of course, as soon as they misbehaved in the slightest, they were immediately shunned by everyone of consequence and excluded from every event, never mind that this was commonly known as The Age of Scandal and every hostess in London would have been competing to get them to spice up their parties.

Even less believable was an incident on the trip to London when one of the women, on her first try, climbed the rigging of a sailing ship with only one hand while wearing the full-length, soft, billowy skirts and petticoats of the period. She accomplished this feat while carrying an apparently idiotically-designed, open-flame lantern with no protective shielding. Not only did the captain-owner of the ship not object, he didn't even stick around to see how horribly wrong this was going to go. Likewise, when she attached the unsafe lamp to the rigging, no one bothered to check that she'd done it properly, resulting in the entire rigging catching fire. How did this happen? Well, she was given the task by her suitor, a young man who was variously described as a fisherman and a shipbuilder, who in some unexplained way had managed to learn how to work a multi-masted cargo ship without the need of any sort of training and wriggled his way into the crew with enough trust to carry out complex nautical tasks unsupervised, all so he could follow his lady love to London unnoticed. Sorry, but fishing boats and long-distance cargo ships were not similar enough that sailing one meant you knew how to sail the other, nor does building ships teach you how to sail them. Why he didn't simply pay for his passage is not explained either.

Then there's the hero, who at the grand old age of 32, is apparently on his fifth career since finishing university. He's done something or other so impressive that he was granted the title of Marquess, learned to run a printing press, established a printing business, learned to sail and captain a ship, and built a shipping empire. And he started those business from scratch, with no start-up money from dad. Apparently the only thing he hasn't done is manage or even visit the estates that he got with the title, because that's how new titles work in Britain, which means he's completely the welfare of all the people associated with the estate who are entirely his responsibility.

Others have pointed out that Blair can't do math. She also doesn't understand early 19th century American society, early 19th century English society, the nature of a landed aristocracy, the concept of the learning curve, or the laws of physics. Throw in a ludicrously naive and erratic heroine and a predictable plot and this book is a serious trainwreck. It would be more believable, just as it is, if was marketed as a parody of bad period romances.",could easily pass for a parody of bad period romance writing,11,1/24/2016

809,4,A2AIE9DO5QSVBD,B0083E6LBM,"These short stories, (currently there are nine), are set in 1950's Britain, and many editorial reviews and descriptions compare them favorably to the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and Enid Blyton's Famous Five series. The comparison to the work of Enid Blyton is particularly apt. The stories vary a little bit in their age appeal, with some stories feeling a bit more advanced in terms of plot, dialogue, and characterization than others. To me, the stories seem to fit in between Blyton's early reader Secret Seven tales and her slightly older Famous Five. They are much younger than classic era Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew.

I think the Moxham full length books, (there are currently seven), that feature these same characters are more rewarding than the short stories, which shouldn't be surprising. In the books you have more characters, more red herrings, more adventures and just a bigger canvas. For older readers, or for kids who have read all of the stories, I'd be on the lookout for those books. (For what it's worth, I'd try to read the first book, ""Mystery of Smuggler Cove"", first. It sets up the locale, the four kids, and the supporting characters. After that you can pretty much mix up the books and stories and read them out of order without missing the thread.)

The short stories are nice little snacks, and are great as an introduction to old-school mystery/action/adventure. The kids are just sketched in because you are familiar with them. There are fewer scenes, a little less suspense, and the wrap ups are a bit more pat. But, that's the nature of the short story and it shouldn't dissuade one from scooping them up to read as fun quickies.

Consider this story. Joe, his sisters Amy and Sarah, and friend Will are larking about and decide to look for hidden loot from an old robbery. There is an abandoned castle nearby, (why did I grow up near an abandoned quarry pit instead of a castle? That's why you need books like this.). Anyway, you end up with dungeons, bad guys, tunnels, escapes, captures, more escapes, cliffs, danger and derring do. Thrilling things happen and justice is done. Throughout it all the kids demonstrate grit, resourcefulness, courage, and loads of all the right stuff.  The story is briskly paced, the action is clear, scenes are effectively set, and dialogue is fairly realistic in an action/suspense sort of way. Somebody almost always has a flashlight/torch with him.

This is a pretty nice package for an early reader. The effect is a bit of a thrill, and if it encourages the reader's taste for further reading, (and day dreaming), then that's just the icing on the cake.

A mother (Jen) has just gone through a divorce that her now ex-husband filed for because he decided that he'd rather be with the children's nanny.  The book focuses on Jen trying to put her life back together after the divorce. The one constant that I did notice throughout the entire book was references to God and having a personal relationship with Him.

While many might want to overlook this book because of the funeral home setting, I appreciated how the setting gave me a new way to look at showing God's love by preparing people's bodies for their burial. Everything that goes into a funeral is done for the living. Showing God's love through death to those that are still living. As a Christian I know that death is not the end, but a new beginning.

Angela Hunt did an amazing job with this book. Although this books main theme was in reference to God in our lives - at no point was it being shoved down the readers throat. Instead, it was a constant theme that tied the whole story together. It allowed the reader to see how God's love  is reflected in us showing others love, in forgiving others, and in loving ourselves.

Prayer was also a constant point. God answers our prayers in His time and in His way.  The main character, Jen, discovers that God always answers our prayers...just not always the way we want Him to.

I would suggest that you get a cup of tea, a box of Kleenex, and find a comfy spot to curl up and read.  You WILL enjoy this book and find yourself wanting to know even more about Jen and her boys by the end. I was SO happy to see that this book was the first in a series!

I found this book to be an interesting story of one womans spiritual journey as she approaches her altered future holding the hands of her two young sons after her husband divorces her because of his involvement with another woman.

If you have seen the movie Hope Floats, then in many ways this is the Christian version, but with a few twists. The writing is solid and the character development is gradual. In fact, I really didn't like Jennifer (Jen) or her mother Joella, but as Jen matured spiritually and looked deeper into her own heart I found myself in her corner cheering her on through her challenges, trials and tribulations. I also had a few LOL moments courtesy of her eldest son. So typical of a young teen.

Martin Caidin has painted several honest pictures of the P-38from its inception, through teething, compressability and myriad improvements. He portrays it in the USA, Alaska, crossing the Atlantic, the ETO, Africa and the westen Pacific. It was always a good aircraft and then became a great one. Great airplanes aren't only built on the drawing board and the factory floor; great airplanes become great because brave and talented young men make them whirr and whip and loop and shoot. Caidin brought the aviators who flew the Forktailed Devil to life, often in their own words. When using his own, he's a fine writer and his descriptions come alive. Reading about these fliers in the P-38 compliments and confirms the detailed research and presentation about the creation of the Lightening. As a naval aviator, I pined reading the book, wanting my hands on those throttles and yoke.

820,4,A1G73RR2GIOBBP,B008E7JZT8,"This beautifully written novel is of a post-apocalyptic world where animals have increased intelligence, societies, and  customs;  and humans are long gone - maybe. The protagonists are all cats although other societies such as dogs and rats exist. Something has been killing cat-seers in a remote monastery, so a group of cats (lions, tigers, etc.) including a Captain of the queen's guard, a Major. a Scholar, an Alchemist, and the Captain's brother are dispatched by their Empress to stop the killings and protect those still alive. One seer is found still alive, so the group of six continues on to find the cause of the deaths. The general flavor of their behavior and society is Japanese, Shogun-like and feudal.

The  characterizations are very strong, consistent, and well done, Each member of the group contributes to their survival although their individual motivations are obscure, especially those of the alchemist and the seer. Their journey is difficult because of the mountains and weather although they follow something similar to the great wall of China with its frequent posts manned (?) by cat soldiers. The bulk of the story concerns the expedition with its trials and tribulations.

829,1,A3BVQHM1C6B9UW,B008EJOBH2,"Wow. I get this on one level. Let's put together a basic guide with a catchy title. That was the notion behind the ""Dummies"" series. At least there is some heft to one of those books. This one is six pages. It is a hodgepodge of truisms and some thoughts that should not be mixed together. There is little logic in the order they are presented. So it is dangerous for anyone attempting to apply it. Consider this notion, spend at least 6% of your revenues in better marketing. There is no substantiation to this and it does not allow for differences in industry.

That led me to a question. Who is the target audience? I only picked it up because it was free. The ""book"" touts itself as ""Probably the most condensed primer you'll ever read on building and marketing your business."" That seems true with the result being an incredibly irrelevant take on a complex and very human business practice.

I cannot think of a single client of mine that would find value or applicability in these six pages. They read like crib notes from a Philip Kotler book...which you should read instead. Once again, it is dangerous to apply any business process without context. The least Burns could have done is provide a case study or two.","This Does Not Dumb-Down Marketing, It Obliterates It",2,10/6/2016

831,5,A1CNDHO5B0V24B,B008O58I4S,"I enjoy this novella so much that I re-read it every year. It is a must read for Jude Deveraux fans, particularly those who love the legendary Taggert family. This novella stands alone, and can be enjoyed by anyone. However, it will hold special delight for anyone who has read previous books featuring the Taggerts. This is a contemporary story and features ""Mac"" Taggert as the hero.

This is a novella, yet it is incredible how much depth of characters and story Jude Deveraux incorporates in this most enjoyable read. As with most of Ms. Deveraux's stories, there is humor and crackling dialogue. There is also a need to be willing to suspend some disbelief; if for some reason it is beyond one's sensibility that two people can fall truly in love within a span of days, then this is not a story for you. If you can accept that some things may not be common, but that doesn't make them impossible, and if you enjoy a glorious happy ever after, then I definitely recommend this. I also particularly recommend this for anyone who likes Christmas novellas",A Favorite Classic Holiday Novella,4,1/1/2017
832,4,A2KUR0ZBNV17AA,B008O58I4S,"Just Curious by Jude Devereaux is a novel I found that I thought would be appropriate for Christmas Day. No crime, no horror, no bad words, and an interesting story with a truly surprising ending makes this an almost perfect review post for Christmas day. There is just a little bit of sex but it is tastefully done and appropriate to the story. It is very definitely written for women, but, hey, a guy can enjoy a well-written story no matter the original target audience.

Karen works in the office of McAllister Taggert, ostensibly as a secretary. But Karen has a secret. She sees herself as an industrial spy. By volunteering to help everyone, work longer hours, and listen to others rather than speak, she intends to become a chief competitor of Taggert when she opens her own business. Before husband Ray died, she and Ray had worked in a failing enterprise and turned it around. If Ray had not died so early, Karen and Ray might have taken the business over. After Ray's death, the only way she could keep her financial interest in the business was to sleep with the remaining partner. Karen decided to start a new business was preferable. Taggert enterprises would be her training ground.

Ray was Karen's true love. It had been two years since his death and she had no interest in finding a replacement. With the biological clock ticking, Karen did want at least one child. She was not interested in getting married. There was a clinic she had visited; she had seen a catalog from which she could pick desirable genetic characteristics.

In the meantime, she is working for Taggert, an unmarried attractive person except for his personality. It seems he almost has a hobby of getting engaged and breaking the engagements days before the weddings. He surrounds himself with a staff of beautiful women, many of whom have sinecures for jobs. Taggert has a reputation as a narcissist and borderline misogynist. And he has a problem. He was invited to a wedding where he would be one of the groom's attendants. He has to attend the wedding and knows that a former fiance will be there. He cannot show up without an escort. He offers employment to Karen to act as an escort (non-sexual).

She accepts; the two go to the Taggert family mansion where the entire rather extended family is present for the wedding. There is only one bedroom for the two of them. See where this is going?

The story after this could get dull. It does not. Devereaux keeps the reader's attention throughout the rest of the novella. The dialogue is interesting, the pace is fast, the characters have more development than I would expect in such a short work. I will use some of her work in my English as a Second Language classes.","Interesting For the Guys, Too",4,12/24/2016

I almost stopped reading with the graphic scene of rape of the boy, b/c I felt it unnecessary to the story just grotesque, but if you can trudge along, it gets a little better. Once most of the characters are introduced, the story flows better. There are some grammatical errors, & alot of redundancy. But, again the plot is intriguing enough to wade through it.

836,2,A3TOMKJ8AD12G2,B008SGZOL8,"Unlike K.J. Jacksons novels Promise and Vow, Flame Moon did not make me cry heartfelt tears; it just frustrated me. My thoughts have nothing to do with historical vs. contemporaryIll read any genreand everything to do with the stories and characters. I might have liked it better at half this length. I read to the middle of chapter 19 (way further than I wanted to), then skipped to read the last half of chapter 21 to get to the end. Some of the amnesia and PTSD parts were good. The sex got repetitive, as did the agonies and betrayals. Content includes gore, kidnapping, prolonged torture.

The romance was a nope. Ditto for the friends and lovers severely wounding each other on purpose out of anger during training. The narrative point-of-view was clunky: maybe eighty percent Skye and twenty from her three new friends, and it wasn't mixed well. My favorite characters were Rafe (the heroic dog), and friends Triaten and Charlotte. Some elements similar to the 1996 Geena Davis movie The Long Kiss Goodnight.

It is really a chronicle about a boy and girl living on the prairie, farmers and how society views them, especially the boy, who was raised by an Indian woman and came from low parentage. Yet the boy is the strongest of the characters, likable, smart, funny with common wit. He goes farther than most of his ilk would, yet comes home for the simple life, eschewing the big city and its illicit lures. The writing is very simple, a bit dull, in spite of some simple views about city life vs. living in small towns and rural farms. The girl never quite changes, always selfish, stubborn and always hoping for more than she has.

839,1,A2SK70F0NANUU8,B008V1UB86,"First of all I have to say that I have loved the author's writing, but there is no sign of the author actually finishing this series.  She has deleted her blog and is not responding to her readers on social media.  Her books are not standalones, and book six, Heller's Regret ended in a cliffhanger.

I would not purchase these books at this time.

Edit:  As I said earlier in another  discussion, J.D. will pop up on Facebook once or twice at the beginning of each year to claim that she is finishing the series that year. And then she doesn't. Year after year. Her son is off to university and she has a fairly mild condition that is easily treated. I know because I have the same condition.

Also, I was the main moderator on her Goodreads group until last year (I quit because I didn't like how she was treating her fans) and was privy to the fact that while she was claiming illness, she was also living an active life that conflicts with her claim of illness. I won't give more details as she does have some expectation of privacy.

However, she has removed her author blog and website. Despite her once a year protest, she has not released a book for almost four years. She used to publish twice a year and give constant progress reports. The bottom line is that it is unlikely she will finish the series.

At this point her faithful fans get angry with me, but I don't want new readers buying these books expecting that this is a complete series. I and several others have contacted Amazon and Audibel and received full refunds. I strongly suggest you do this and write reviews letting people know that the author has stopped writing.

841,5,A2ZSFKTJZUJ1SK,B008VSIMOY,"In reviewing a book I have read my first criterion is how was the story? This story was very good. My second criteria is how were the characters? In this story the characters, and the divide between them, are clearly drawn. And then I ask myself, how did I feel about the characters? In this book I loved the characters that I was supposed to love and hated the characters that I was supposed to hate. The dichotomies drawn between good and evil were stark and easily fathomed. Finally I ask myself how the book grew from place to place and what foreshadowing I saw? This book was filled with foreshadowing that then became flashbacks. Those are devices I have used myself. I saw the foreshadowing easily enough and drew the conclusions I was supposed to draw. That made the twists of the book a little less suspenseful but it did not detract from the story or the presentation of ending. The one twist I did not see was in the climactic event of the book though it too had been foreshadowed. \
There are many morals to this story. If you are looking for a shallow and only an entertaining story this is probably not for you. It has depth and it has philosophy that occupies the thoughts of the characters and the reader. I give it a five star rating even though it angered me in many places.

It's mostly the sanitized stuff you would expect from the era.  Violence is muted, sexuality non-existent, authority is to be respected, good triumphs over evil.  Character development is generally poor, because, it seems to me, the author wants the reader to identify with the main character, so they are hardly defined at all.  Still, these stories stretched the imagination, and made you think.  They were also optimistic about the future, which seems to be a forgotten art.  No, it doesn't subvert the dominant paradigm, but I am so tired of that anyway.  This was social vaccination, a sign of what people were worried about at the time.  I give it four stars not because it's great stuff, because it was important to me and my imagination, and also because it is a window into the pre-Vietnam, cold war era.","A teenage social vaccine from the fifties, but optimistic and a bit mind-stretching.",3,10/4/2016

To summarize the plots, in Icerigger a small group of commonwealth citizens are stranded on an ice world with a primitive civilization, thousands of miles from the commonwealth outpost. This is their story of how they interact with the natives and make their way to the the outpost. In Mission to Moulokin, the group of humans works on creating a world government so the natives can apply for an elevated membership in the commonwealth. In The Deluge Drivers, they encounter and deal with a plot by other humans to terraform the planet and make it suitable for human occupation.

These three novels were written over a significant number of years, and it shows. The first two books came fairly early in Foster's writing career, and subsequently lack some of the awesomeness that characterizes his later works.

First, despite it being a professionally published book, I was surprised by the proofreading errors (""as"" for ""at""; ""that"" for ""what"") and editing errors (having your protagonist describe her reflection in a mirror is a huge no-no). And what's this with all the ""began""s. He began to ___; she began to ___. Why not just have your characters do something? Why add that unnecessary ""began""? And why ever does she break into new paragraphs in such random places? But apparently the editors at Bethany House are okay with it, so who am I to complain?

As for the story, we learn in chapter two the whole plot is built on a misunderstanding that can be cleared up in a single conversation. Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to have a misunderstanding stretched on and on until you're ready to scream, ""Oh come on! Just talk already!"" If a couple can't handle something so simple, how will they face the more serious issues marriage and family present? Clearly these two are not meant for one another, and the more I read, the more convinced I became. Who would possibly want to marry a girl who causes nothing but trouble?

But it's an amusing read, if you don't take it too seriously. You see the ending coming from the moment we learn there's another man involved (somewhere on page 5, I think), but there's nothing wrong with building towards the happy ending the reader is expecting.

From the sales rank of all the books, it's beyond clear that the author can afford to have the series proofread. Why not do it? If you have a beautiful model and you're doing a photoshoot, you'd wipe specks of dirt off the model's face, right? It's a distraction when I'm cruising along, loving the story, eager to discover what's going to happen next - because the surprises are always surprising - and then BAM some misspelled word, or a typo, or some other easily repairable error suddenly takes my attention away from the narrative. I keep asking, Why? Why doesn't she have this fixed? Make the small investment the story deserves.

She's a former nurse, and thinks about the mystery surrounding the death of an elderly lady...did she die of natural causes, or was she murdered? Reece thinks she was murdered, due to the circumstances in which she was found, but how to prove it? She applies her nursing skills in formulating a ""care plan"" to answer her unanswered questions. There are many twists and turns and even thought I thought I knew who the murderer was, it turned out I was wrong. I love that, because after the person was revealed, I realized there were clues sprinkled throughout the book, but I never picked up on them. I'm going to get the next two books in the series.

I like the suspenseful opening of this book. It grabbed my attention right away, and the action was very well paced. Zoe was a well written character, and I enjoyed her personality. The supporting characters were good, though a bit cliched at times.

Best bits: They seem to have a solid moral background, talking freely about waiting on God's timing, etc., and stating concern about the ethics of Wade being Katies study partner while filling in as her teacher, wanting to avoid even the appearance of wrong.

Issues: Nothing here made me particularly invested in either main character. Katie comes across as rather shallow and clueless, though we are TOLD she is kind and intelligent. Wade fares a little better, with his dedicated affection for Katie, but really, why on earth give in to the set-up dates?

Her father, a Baron, and her brother Randolph basically sold her in marriage at the age of 16 to a wealthy 'cit', George Waddley. The plan backfires, as George refuses to further line their pockets, and he treats Cecilia like a princess. Eight years later, George is murdered near the docks, ostensibly by footpads, but Cecilia doesn't think so. According to George's journal, there were some vile, illegal doings at his shipping company, and Cecilia is convinced that he was murdered because he found out the truth. She re-enters London society under the auspices of her aunt Jessamine, Vicountess Meriton, to search for clues. Enigmatic Sir James Branstoke is intrigued by Cecilia ~ she passes herself off as an eccentric, frail, featherbrained woman as a way of disguising her real agenda, but Branstoke somehow sees through the ruse. The story really develops into more of a murder mystery with multiple suspects and a few surprise revelations that I did NOT see coming.

890,4,ANQ7TQBXHMBY7,B0099E17MI,"I love Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series, and have recently become a fan of the Five Hundred Kingdoms books despite my reluctance to start reading yet another rewritten fairy tale - but I ended up buying one by accident (it wasn't listed as being a part of the series) and was so well pleased with it that I purchased all the other available books in the series.
This isn't just a rewrite of a fairy tale (or in this case a myth) to make it into another version of the same thing - this is a series of books written in a world view that is uniquely driven by The Tradition (a force that is both natural and magical, which attempts to create the circumstances that ensure stories follow the templates expected, stories acted out by the people that live in the various kingdoms of this world). People can move between kingdoms, and in each kingdom The Tradition is a little bit different or, in some cases, a LOT different. Therefore, the fairy tales become intermingled with stories from a variety of backgrounds, and the books are therefore anything but a cookie cutter repeat of the fairy tales (myth in this case) they get their starting point from. This particular story is rooted in ancient mythology and involves gods and goddesses, with a few interesting twists and a new perspective on what was once a very different story, but The Tradition is not well explained.
While each book in the series builds on material from previous installments, they are usually easily stand alone books. The first one I read was from somewhere in the middle of the series, and mentioned characters or activities from earlier installments, but I didn't realize it until I read the earlier books. Later ones seem to mention more from the earliest ones, but not enough that you would be lost if you read the last one first.
This particular story is not as easily a stand alone story  it is too short (having come from an anthology originally it was limited in length), and has minor characters from a previous book called ""The Sleeping Beauty"" as very central characters here; and, unfortunately, understanding the world view before you read it is important to understanding the combination of the material. But if you aren't inhibited by not having the background, it is fine all alone  I don't think I would have liked it as much as a separate purchase if I hadnt already read earlier books in the series. If you buy the other books in the series, this one would follow after ""The Sleeping Beauty"" book, but can be read anywhere after that one as the only characters it calls on from previous books are from that one.
I would like to see this fleshed out and finished up as a full length book. As a shorter story it has to leave out too much, whereas if it were a full-length book those lacks could be better addressed. All the same - well written as I always expect from Mercedes Lackey.",I love Mercedes Lackey's Valdemar series,2,8/10/2016
891,4,A18B0T2O25SFT9,B0099LPCWC,"Breezy (Breanne) Jones is a 28-year-old meteorologist who is the weathergirl for he news team at KWAC TV in Aspen Grove, California. She's literally grown up in the newsroom there, as the previous weathercaster was her father. The community loves her sweet, girl-next-door style of delivering the news and she loves the community back, with no desire to ever live elsewhere. She already has her dream job here.

Noah Drake becomes the new station manager when KWAC is sold. He and his assistant general manager, Gabe Weston, have a reputation that has earned them the nickname ""The Firing Squad."" Breezy, the eternal optimist, is determined to remain positive... until she overhears him referring to her as ""Pollyanna"" in the most negative sense of the term.

The Pride and Prejudice parallels are obvious, especially when the sexy Pamela Gladstone (Hurricane Pamela) shows up with a very Caroline Bingley-like attitude toward the ""peasants"" she works with, aside from Noah. Breezy's mother is quite Mrs. Bennet-like in her desire to see her daughter married. However, this book also deviates significantly from P&P, so there's no predicting exactly how things will play out.

There are a couple of homonym-type misspellings (born/borne and another one or two others I can't specifically recall), but otherwise the writing is quite good. Ms. Horrocks does a nice job of creating a hometown feeling in Aspen Grove; the reader gets a Bedford Falls (It's A Wonderful Life) sense about the place.

She introduces a number of characters who will obviously continue throughout this series of books. Unfortunately, many of them don't figure much into this plot, and there are too many to remember if you're reading this as a stand-alone.

Among the stand-out supporting players here: Andrew North is a surfer-dude who's Breezy's ex-boyfriend. Candy Kane(!!) is proprietor of Candy's Cafe hosting Chick Flick Clique movie nights every Wednesday with Breezy and her friends.

I really like the dynamics between Noah and Breezy. There's a nice spark between them, both in their conversations and physically. She's immediately attracted to him and often struggles to maintain her dislike for him personally despite her abhorrence for what he's doing to her beloved news office. Meanwhile, Noah quickly recognizes that he underestimated Breezy and that he'd REALLY like to go out with her. He hates having Pamela around poisoning the work atmosphere at the station, but his hands are tied by the firm directives of the station owner, Mr. Bentley.

I do find it hard to believe that Noah would interview any of his employees, and surely not an on-air personality, without thoroughly reviewing their HR files. Instead, Breezy's qualifications surprise him, which is ridiculous. The author could achieve the same effect sticking to Breezy's much-younger-than-her-age appearance and her unsophisticated approach to delivering the news.

Onerall, this book has a very pleasant, wholesome quality. Content is clean and Biblical-type morals are demonstrated, yet there are glimpses of the darker side of humanity in the real world. Despite its flaws, I really liked it.","Pleasant, wholesome, modern Pride and Prejudice",3,1/7/2018

Romancing Wisconsin Series Book 1
This series is about Love finding a way to bloom in Wisconsin during any season.
Christmas in July at a zoo for Eric Riley and Marissa Wilder who are both single parents and both have a daughter the same age. Reese Riley and Heather Wilder have met recently and hit it off 100%. Marissas day had not started off in the best way. Eric was supposed to be with the children however he got interrupted on his way to the school by an automobile accident. He saved a mans life. First she thinks of Eric as a no show dad but once she hears the reason she changes her mind. Eric does not bring up the fact he was at the accident since he does not like to brag. vvSo Marissa was filling in on this class trip for him. She had heels on as she was not expecting to walk around the zoo. She ended up hurting her ankle when the heel on her shoe got stuck between 2 boards. Eric being a paramedic checked out her ankle. She got a ride in a golf cart that was done up in Christmas things, candy cane and holly boughs and even a mistletoe and a driver that looked like Santa. Reese reminded her dad that the rule is if you're under the mistletoe you have to kiss.  Santa would not move till they did. He is quite the match maker. The Summer Santa was dressed in red boxer shorts and matching flip-flops. Santa had a way for Marissa to get an x-ray without a trip to the hospital, after all the zoo had one for x-rays they needed for animals.
Eric is impressed by her making an alphabet score sheet for the girls to fill out about the animals they see. Both Eric and Marissa had their own stories but they sure were two people worthy of finding love again.
Later Marissa is impressed with the wood working that Eric does. He has a military back ground also.
I won't spoil anymore about the story of Santa Butchs tricks and also Eric, Marissa, Reese and Heather.
Could not wait to read more books of the series to learn more about Santa Butch, his wife Judy, and the Riley family!

First, lets talk about a huge plot hole. John didn't know his wife was alive, yet somehow at the end of the book her guards betrayed her?  And all of a sudden John knew she was alive. Yeah, lets just brush over everything else that happened and the surprise at seeing his wife alive after breaking into Cams mind.

Lewis cant remember anything but they can share memories and she doesnt share them so he can at least have some of his life back? But his heart remembered her. Bleh.

The end was so anticlimactic. Everyone knew everything that was going to happen, but just decided it wasn't a good idea to let key players in on the plan? I mean com on!

And for the final nail in the coffin:
I missed you, he whispered, his voice catching.

It is an exciting adventure that follows the expanding friendship of two boys from opposite tribes, one being a Highlander and the other a Lowlander. It is comical how the young boys fuss at each other, as only young boys can do, to show how ""big"" they are. This novel will grab your attention and keep you reading well into the night.

Kuini and Coyotl, who meet accidentally, are from different backgrounds and social statuses. Coyotl is the son of the Emperor of his tribe while Kuini is the son of a War Leader of his tribe. They learn and share with each other about their tribes ways of doing all things. Kuini, who is an excellent artist, learns to read with the help of Coyotl. When Kuini finds himself in Coyotl's noble world, he finds danger at every corner, especially when Kuini meets and falls in love with Coyotl's sister, Iztac. Customs demand that the two lovers may never see each other again after the girl is married to a husband she does not want, just so her father can appease the leader of another tribe.

This novel is extremely well written as only Zoe Saadia can do. Her research is very apparent as you go from pyramids, to temples, to palaces. This novel is rich in historical detail. You will become involved in what all the characters can and will do page after page. There are plenty of conflicts interfering with the lives of all the main and secondary characters.

925,3,A1JOZFD5CCXEBF,B009FN1DA4,"One of the things for which San Francisco is famous is its sourdough bread.  Unlike other breads, each loaf must contain a starter, a piece of dough that has been cultured for many years.  There are differences between various cultures and a lot of competition to have the best one.  Enough competition to kill for.
 That is what happens in THE SOURDOUGH WARS.  One of the best sourdough bakeries closed when the owner died and his children fought over what to do with the starter.  The daughter, Anita, wanted the bakery.  She got the house.  The son, Peter, wanted the house.  He got the bakery.
 Awhile later, a theater group with which Peter was involved was trying to stay in business.  Someone suggested auctioning of the starter to raise funds for the project.  There were four potential buyers: Two feuding brothers from the San Francisco area, each of whom had a bakery specializing in sourdough, a woman from the area who had a small, independent bakery and, possibly, the best sourdough bread in the area, and an out-of-towner who represented a large corporation.  While the quartet waited and waited and waited for the auction to begin, Peter didn't show up.  He had been murdered.
 Each of the four members of the group may have had a reason to kill him.  So did Anita.  Rebecca Schwartz, a  Jewish feminist lawyer who was helping with the auction, suddenly became one of those trying to find the murderer.
 One of the main complications of solving the crime was the interference of a reporter who was determined to get the story first. Reporters never seem to care what kind of chaos is unleashed as a result of their handiwork; every day they open a new and different Pandoras Box and don't give a damn about the consequences.
 There is a common thread throughout the story: parental favoritism.  How parents, and others, view a person, does have a lasting effect on how they live their lives.  It often drives a wedge between siblings.  As Anita stated, I really hated him, you know that?  I wanted to humiliate him the way my parents humiliated meI wanted to show him up as incompetent.  So you know what I did?  I let it get in my way.  If Id offered him decent money for the starter, hed have sold it to me and wed both have been happy, but I had to control him into the bargain.
 Revenge may not be the most uplifting theme of the human psyche, but it can be comforting sometimes.
 Author Julie Smith uses humor and witty dialogue throughout the story.  Near the beginning, she wrote, Its just one of those ineffable things said Mickey.  That was the way she usually handled Kruzickby using words he couldn't understand.
 Other examples are Over the bridge and through Marin, to Sallys place we went. and, in response to a two short sentence dialogue:  Supplying the third line of a rhyming triplet.  I had to go back and reread it.  I had missed the rhyming.
 There is a thorough explanation of the history of sourdough: What it is.  How it got to San Francisco.  Why its important.
 The book was published in 1984.  I would hope there would be some changes now to reflect changing social awareness.  She was ahead of her time on her attitude toward the gay community but her stereotypical descriptions of her Jewish mother were offensive.  Besides her caricature of a mother, Rebecca was Jewish had nothing to do with the story. She isn't observant when she briefly describes eating shellfish, definitely not kosher.

931,5,A328S9RN3U5M68,B009G1WQB0,"Author Peggy A. Edelheit has managed (in a writing range that is solid) to create what every author of romance adventures wants  a character so balanced and so real that all who read her series (of which this is book 5) end up saying Everybody loves Samantha1. Samantha Jamison is an author/sleuth and it is because of her well-sculpted personality that she manages to attract every one who comes across the good fortune of reading either all or some of this series.

Peggy jump starts this 5th book of the Samantha Jamison Mysteries  MOUTH OF THE RAT   with her own vigor that revs up the story and explains the title: The meaning of the name Boca Raton has always aroused curiosity. Many people wrongly assume the name is simply Rats Mouth. The Spanish word boca, or mouth, often describes an inlet, while raton means, literally, mouse. The term Boca de Ratones
 or Boca Ratones was a navigational, referring to a rocky or jagged inlet, but the original location of Boca de Ratones was Biscayne Bay near present-day Miami Beach, according to eighteenth century maps. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the term was mistakenly applied to the current Lake Boca Raton, whose inlet was closed throughout most of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The s and later the  e were dropped from this title by the 1920s, yet the correct pronunciation remains Rah-tone. Very typical of Peggys respect for her audience to include information such as this  and a fine springboard for her mystery.

It is that kind of background early on in her books that makes Peggys Samantha books sparkle. Add to the romantic and physical aspects some very well considered mystery development and you have another terrific outing with our favorite author/sleuth. Oh yes, a hint of where Samantha is going in this edition - Mona is frantic. ""Marco is dead! Come quick!"" Who's Marco? I had a week to solve it, but began to think it was unsolvable. It involved murder, drugs, an ex-wife, and an antique car collection. Who did it? Male/Female?.

Hop on for another quick read that will entertain you during and after your accompanying Samantha Jamison.  Peggy A Edelheits books are habit forming  in the best sort of way. Grady Harp, July 16",Who was the rat with the kiss of death?,2,7/8/2016

Nick is a gorgeous owner of fitness spas. He's made his wealth on his own merit. His business is growing and the last thing he needs is a bump in the road. He gets several in the story. One of them being his assistant quits without notice and he hires a temp. Then there is the issue of his adoption that he found out about in a shocking way.

I stuck with it to the bitter end just to see how it ended, and I'm thankful it's over. Now I'm putting Annie Katz on my ""Never Read Again"" list and if you care to know why, read on and I'll tell you. Note: SPOILERS AHEAD

I actually made it through all of the Mother Earth, Dream Mother, Mother Ocean, Mother Sky, Mother Food, Pray To Everything, and so-on without too much pain, though the author sure had all the New Age stuff down pat.  But still I was kind of caught up in the story. Then I reached the 75% point and suddenly the book had nearly every anti-gun talking point constantly spouted by the professional gun haters. Here are some examples:

""The more paranoid a person is, the more he needs weapons and shield, and the more dangerous he is to himself and others. The most courageous among us need no weapons, no shields."" Location 4015

""Maybe that's why people carry guns around,"" she said. ""To scare the rest of us or to make us think they are powerful, that they could do anything they want because they have a gun and we don't.""  Location 4010

""I'd rather make peace than war. Especially with paranoid folks who love guns.""  Location 4023

""...we were talking about fearful people needing guns to feel safer."" Location 4180

""...a reminder of how dangerous guns are.""  Location 4712

And of course after writing a column on guns, a drunken gun owner shot up her barber shop. Now her first draft - printed in full in the book - clearly showed her bias against guns, but in all fairness, the actual column Lila put in the newspaper was not bad. As she said, ""I wanted to stress meeting, not stress my personal bias about handguns."" (Location 4465)

But since all gun owners are evil, stupid or drunken bums, the author HAD to have one overreact. Otherwise people might not understand that guns = bad!

And also of course at the town meeting, a whole bus of gun owners showed up. It was ""...full of men from a gun club. Not one woman was on the bus.""  Cause only men could be dumb enough to want a gun. And of course those gun guy bullies monopolized the meeting and interrupted and intimidated anyone who tried to talk.

I found the last one-fourth of the book to be openly biased against lawful gun ownership and cannot recommend it to anyone.",Flagrant Anti-Gun Propaganda,5,7/7/2017
944,3,A3NILSED8WXNFS,B009M9MILE,"Like so many of the books on Amazon, this one is not in the right category. I bought it because it was listed as literary fiction, which generally appeals to an adult or young adult audience.  Lila Blue is  most definitely a Middle Grade book as the protagonist is only twelve.  Because the story targets younger readers, the novel presents a few problems.  First, it is too long.  I know of few high schoolers who would stay engaged in this story for its entirety, much less middle grade students.  Second, the novel is a collection of loosely connected stories that don't seem to be tightly tied to a theme or a purpose.  Finally, much of the book lets the reader figure out the point, which isn't consistent with the age level targeted.  For example, many of the truisms of Lila are left hanging, without a real clarity about their purpose or meaning. So  I think the author is writing on one level and targeting an audience on another.
However, I do like the characters and the setting. Also, I think the premise is a good one, and  there are solid lessons to be learned from Cassandra's grandmother.  I just wish the writing wasn't so lofty as to miss the audience who could benefit the most from it.",Out of reach...,4,12/14/2016

In that regard this tome is no juvenile accomplishment, whatever the intended audience. Not a great many novels lands in my to- be- re-read column. This is one such.

960,4,A264UDLWWRJ7X4,B009R7M7OE,"An intricately-plotted fast-paced romantic romp that takes place over the course of one madcap day, this novel really delivers.

On the day before her wedding to Jake, our heroine, Rennie, seeks out her ex-boyfriend, Con, to confess in person that his grandmother has been swindled while under Rennie's care.  From this simple beginning, this talented author spins a tale that encompasses con men, gangsters, ambitious news reporters, stoner hotel staff, a day spa that turns into a brothel at night, and a ""health mine"" where tourists pay to enter an abandoned gold mine to sit in lichen slime and breathe radon gas.

The cast of characters includes a former teen grifter trying to stay straight, a super rich game designer who can't seem to help seeing life in terms of competition, a prissy con man who wears ""man makeup,"" and a mob enforcer who is in the market for a nice diamond ring for his wife.  The love triangle between Rennie, Con and Jake is funny and engaging.  Despite the importance of the twisty-turny plot, these are all three-dimensional characters with fascinating backstories and realistic character traits.

The author does tend to do some head-hopping in her narration, so it is sometimes hard for the reader to figure out which character's head they are in.  But the author has a flare for witty dialogue that can be really funny.

This story is well written, action packed and full of intrigue.

Bailey Saunders returns to her mother's home right after being notified of her mother's death. The funeral is completely set up and payed for. Bailey isn't sure what is off but something is wrong. A man talks to her at the funeral. A man breaks into her house. Another man tries to kill her. The first man tells her she isn't who she thinks she is.

This was a fast-paced, edge of your seat kind of crime/mystery. The action and suspense just kept coming! Every time I sat down to read, it was for longer than I intended.  Bailey and Guy, the main characters, are likeable and have real flaws, not stereotypical as you find in many stories. I could not predict how they would handle situations which made them believable. The author took her time to build credible relationships and unfold the plot. There were plenty of twists and turns that kept me guessing.
Guy, a private detective, is hired by an adoptive relative to find her long, lost granddaughter Cassidy, who was kidnapped at birth. Bailey finds out from Guy, after the woman she thought was her mother dies, that she has been living a lie. Not even her name is real. No one is as they seem and she is not sure who she can trust. Instead of living the luxurious life of the wealthy young heiress she should have been entitled, her childhood was poverty and moving from town to town, scrounging the streets with the woman she called mother to survive. Her reappearance spells disastrous consequences for two very powerful and dangerous men who will stop at nothing to make her disappear.

It was nice not to have to cope with Reed's sweating and his constant and overwhelming social insecurity being larger characters than Billie.

975,1,A1HBTW5M7ZZ9PT,B009Y3ON4I,"This is one of those rare books I'm DNFng, but I wish I wasn't. Let me explain. I love Ransom Riggs, along with his wife Tahereh Mafi; I feel they're an amazing couple, extremely talented, and just good people. Because of this, I tend to unfailingly fangirl for them; meaning, I may hype them up without seeing enough literature to hype them up reasonably.

Before this book, I'd only read Ransom's Ms. Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children; even then, it was on Audible. I loved it and even bought the paperback recently, so I could have the full set of the series. Well, I'm abandoning this series, so a full set will most likely never be had, but I had said all this to say this; it's important to see authors as their writing, not just their awesome personality and happenstance of being a writer.

Which leads me to my review of this book.

Hollow City picks up immediately after the events of Ms. Peregrine's. Since this is the case, I assumed this book would be just as amazing as the first; it would set the tone, be engaging (if slow), and would build a slow creepiness. After 200+ pages of this book, putting it on hold twice, and telling myself I'd reward myself with Tales of the Peculiar if I finished this book, I know it's just a dud for me.

Hollow City is, quite literally, one of the most uneventful books I've ever read in my life. You see, there are things that happen in this book; many things that fall in direct line with deus ex machina, but they aren't interesting. We see the children almost get killed, we see talking animals (I can't even get started on this one; this post would be way too long), and we see that this supposedly fast-paced book is without a plot.

Because, in my opinion, going on a search to turn Ms. Peregrine back into a human isn't a plot.

No, it really isn't. A plot, for me, is something that involves character growth; something that deepens the characters in the first book, molds them, and shows who they really are. In this book, we simply get character approved sayings, descriptions, and Jacob being insecure in place of real substance. There's nothing here.

I'm actually reminded of Lawrence of Arabia...

There is nothing in this book and no man needs nothing.

We meet talking wights, typical hollowgasts, Jacob continuing to be weak, Emma being bossy, Bronwyn being a bad bitch, Olive being adorable, Hugh being amazing, Horace being annoying, and Willard being the only one I can truly stomach any day of the week. I'm so disappointed in this book; especially considering it took supposedly three years to write. To me, this means the author may have been dealing with writer's block...not working to create a masterpiece.

To avoid whining further, I'm going to stop my review after this paragraph. This book could've been something beautiful and amazing; something to do the first book justice, but it doesn't. Instead, we get a gimmicky book that seems mostly circumstantial and not...whole. We see characters reacting in ways the author feels they should be; not as the characters would.

In a word, this book makes me sad.",A let down.,10,11/6/2016
976,2,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B009Y3ON4I,"2.5 Stars. The first book of Miss Peregrine didn't blow me away, but it had enough potential that I wanted to continue the story. Unfortunately, the second book failed to do so. Hollow City reminded me a lot of the first half of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  a lot of moving around avoiding bad guys with very little progress. For HP, that was okay because readers were brought to that point by 6 books of character development and exciting stories. Almost the entirety of Hollow City follows the children, that we hardly know, on the run from wights.

I read the first 50 pages of this book and then put it down for a couple weeks because it just didn't pull me in. When I finally got back to it, I realized why - the photographs. Including weird vintage photos was a cool concept in the first book, inspiring some delightful characters. However, it becomes extremely limiting here. The author forces the narrative around the photos instead of around his protagonists. This means a lot of random encounters that don't progress the plot, but allow another photo to be included. Thatd be okay if there was some character development, but there isnt. Its mostly a cat and mouse game until the very end when the story is finally given some meat (and the focus narrows to Jacob & Emma).

Overall, I thought this was a disappointment  a bridge book meant to stretch a thin story even further. Readers can simply read the last 3-4 chapters and have all they need to go into the next book. Ill read the last book because Im curious to see where Jacob ends up, but I truly hope the author focuses on his protagonists and not the strange photos.

Final note: Usually I keep my reviews to the content of a book, but these deserve a little extra recognition. The hardcover editions of these books are really beautiful. The paper is thicker than standard, with small embellishments to the design and the size is a bit more compact. They have a weight to them that underlies excellent quality.

979,4,A7VNF0SRD0VMC,B009Y3ON4I,"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was an excellent first novel. Of course it had its limitations and growing pains of a fledgling book, but I appreciated the new story and unusual gang of characters. There is a sideshow, vaudeville theme combined with creepy photos from history. The main character is dealing with tragedy and new found extraordinary life. Young adults, of a sort, coming of age, of a sort (oooo--mystery), while they travel across South England. These ragamuffins are actually quite endearing. The second book is even quite the improvement on the first gaining it an easy 4.5 stars.

This is not a horror story; this is not a pee-your-pants, bone-tingler; this is not for those who wish to shut the book in the freezer. Perhaps for this reason the books have been getting a mix of praise and abysmal reviews. Know what you are reading before you rate it in the trash bin. The book is about a group of teenagers. If you expected it to be anything but a tad bit creepy and chock full of odd, then shame on you.

The adventure continues on directly where the last book left off. This beginning is not made to just walk right into; you will need to read the first novel to understand the plight the children find themselves facing. As the story develops, we get to meet even more peculiar children and even a few peculiar animals, and the pacing for the whole plot is quite right. There is a deadline to this story, and we are certainly pushed along (while also getting to enjoy the scenery). The writing develops quite nicely in this sophomore novel as well as the plot. I can really feel this author getting his feet under him.

The book abruptly ends as with the first novel. The story itself is wrapped up nicely, but we are then presented with so many new questions. Excellent form of cliffhanger. I look forward to the third novel.",Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was an excellent first novel,7,3/13/2016

981,3,A2IZ2NUGDV43BI,B009Y9OEDM,"I rarely read a book with so few reviews, even if it free, but the sample was so well written, it sucked me in as I imagined myself in Alannys' place.  Mostly I liked it, but there are places where I rolled my eyes and skimmed. There were times I found myself thinking ""Reeeeallyyy?  Seriously??""  Great portions are really good, but often bogs down in conversations.  Ms. Miller writes conversations mostly very well, but too many times I felt we could get the same information with in half the pages.

What I loved:  I'm a musician and a music teacher, I teach k-12, and I'm a vocalist.  I can confirm  Alannys' job situation is sadly all too real.  Those of us with administrators that support (non-marching band) fine arts are the lucky ones.  The premise of art being power and a song can break the world--I mean, what musician wouldn't jump at that?  Especially in Alannys' situation?  Oh, yes, please, sign me up!

What I did not love/got on my nerves:  I wish Alannys would decide what she's going to do and to be.  One minute she's using her brain, the next she's a wimp.  One minute she wants the truth, the next she wants to ""hide from it as long as I can"".  She goes to great lengths to retrieve her violin, yet once she does, we never see it again?  Whats up with that?

And shes not the only one.  In one moment, another character suddenly goes from blinding murderous rage to compliantly preaching tolerance.  Boom.  Just like that.  Reeeeallyyy?

The only time I will review a book that is a one is if it is wasted my time and is full of vulgar material F bombs and similar lewd content

Technically the characters are weak the plot is all over the place all Male characters, heroes included, are emasculated, mentally weak, and portrayed as emotional Simps.

The way the characters meander through the story is both mentally frustrating and depressingly unbelievable.

The best thing I can say about this book is it has a pretty girl on the front cover

This book is less than one star and I highly discourage anyone from wasting their time with it

985,4,A2U3BSRZFY3M6B,B009YLKRAO,"Rebekkah Franck has a nose for news and really bad taste in men. Here is a novel whose tautly crafted plot is the skeleton upon which the characters provide all the meat that is necessary to tell the story. THREE, FOUR is gristly and raw, and lends itself to my metaphor quite nicely.

When you see the titles in the Rebekkah Franck series, you immediately start singing the old nursery rhyme One, two buckle my shoe; three four close the door, and so on. The titles also let you know that you are reading the books in the right order. There is enough continuity in this, the second book, for me to appreciate having read the first in the series. On the other hand, it is possible to pick this one up and get enough background while turning the pages to see what comes next.

For me, a good series needs a good back story. I often wait until it seems like there will be no new books added to a series so I can binge read them one after another. The back story needs to develop over time so that the characters do not stagnate. The back story here is both realistic and dynamic.

She's quick to reject her photographer, Sune, thinking of him as a boy while getting the hots for the more mature macho psycho killer. Maybe she's not as sharp as she's cracked up to be, but certainly as shallow. This sado-masochistic villain exudes a little Hitchcock and takes his revenge to a whole nother level.

This book is about a serial killer who performs lobotomies on their victims, which is topical given the recent biography about Rosemary Kennedy. While a gruesome subject, the book is not particularly gory. I am learning that Willow Rose does not write the Agatha Christie type of mystery where there are a certain number of characters in a setting (boat, house party, small, close-knit neighborhood, etc.) and one of them is the killer for a reason hidden in the clues. Willow Rose's books seem more about telling an entertaining story, although in all of her mysteries that I have read to date, the killer is one of the secondary, sometimes peripheral, characters. One may guess the murderer, but it will be a guess, because the reason for the murders is unknown, although it has something loosely to do with the plot. If you want to be an armchair sleuth, these may not be your type of mystery, unless you want a particular challenge.

Told through the voice of one young student who has been bullied his entire life. We get to hear and feel everything he goes through. It is hard enough for him, that his father moves the family around a lot (for his job). He wants to fit in, wants to have friends, but that just does not seem to happen.

Then one day he just seems to ""snap"". He feels the need to stand up for himself, and those who have been bullied. When the tables are turned and the ""bullied"" becomes the one in control with revenge and vengeance on his mind, things turn ugly very quick.

A fantastic story with a believable plot. That to me was what make The 8th so frightening, something like this could really happen.

In ways it did remind me of Stephen Kings Rage only in that it shares the same sort of theme. I'm glad Matt hasn't pulled this in anyway as I feel King has taken on some sort of misplaced responsibility and made a mistake by pulling it.

If anything I think Matt shows here that there are others going through this sort of thing and in a way that can help other kids and in its own way show that this isn't the solution. I also completely understand and relate to the feeling within that teachers and authority figures will often talk about not bullying but can even be bullies themselves.

On the whole a very wonderful and enjoyable story that is touching and still contains all the wonderful elements of extreme horror.

So, obviously the blurb really sounded good to me.  I believe I reviewed the latest version of Supernatural Freak.

I felt the story had potential, it certainly started off with a bang.  We were right in the action as Rob's (aka Robyn) client turns into a werewolf, no fault of his own.  She escapes (no spoiler otherwise the book would be over), but that's it.  No following up with the client the next day, she just abandons him and that's it.  What?!?

The story needed editing, there's way too much in it, yet what there is isn't developed enough.  Why does Robyn describe herself as a ""supernatural freak""? Yes, she has some abilities, but are we supposed to assume the ""freak"" part comes just because she told some kids she could do something when she was 5 and they didn't believe her? Boo hoo, doesn't it happen to everyone at some point when they're a kid? This is a person who considers supernatural beings a common part of her life.  It doesn't make sense.  First of all, why is she different? What are the extent of her powers, at least as she knows to this point?  Things are introduced, barely, there's little development and when there is it's in drips and drabs as the story goes on so the reader is confused.  I had to go back and reread several pages at a time to figure out what was going on.  So, I wanted to quit at 40%, but managed to drag myself to 76%.
Enough.

Then there's the weird name usage.  Uncle? Niece? Then the author uses a variety of names for the same character.  She uses the last name for Sir Francis for along time, then switches to Sir Francis and I thought it was a different character, same with Gock aka Mr. Wang (and what is the deal with Gock anyway? More development is needed for characters that are important to the story).  Uncle Terry ""spits"" a lot when he's communicating instead of ""says"" or other verbs:  """"No"", he spits.""

I finally quit after Rob and pals run from the council (why?) and she's given a talisman (What does it do? Why isn't she told all the details?) then it works on someone (Why, isn't he human? Was this role latent? Why? Why was he chosen, if not?)  Too many questions, not enough set up.  We don't get enough of these points vital to the story yet there are sections that read like a history text such as several pages about Titianna.

* I am posting the same review for all 4 books by this author. *
It just makes it easier as it applies to all the books.

I began this series with the Redeeming series.  As I began the first book I wasn't so sure I would like it.  The ONLY reason being I am not religious and this book has a lot of religious overtones.  Which are in the description, and thats my own hang-up and has nothing to do with the author or story line.  With that being said, I really enjoy books that take place in the 1800s and these are the types of story lines I enjoy reading.  So I kept reading.  So I do read a lot of Christian Historical Romance books because of that factor.  However, I was religious in my youth and still have very close friends that are exactly like the characters in these books.  So that part is very accurate and I respect that.  I got to the end of the first book and I was hooked.!!!  I loved the fact that this series kept with the same people and you really got to know them and it just sucks you right in.

The ONLY thing I didn't like was the fact that the author used common and modern words and phrases.  It would have been much better if the author had looked for what really might have been said then in terms of phrases but also certain words.  I normally highlight these things so I can go back should I want to write a review, but with this book I didn't do that.  So I cant go back to the phrases, but there are words that stick out in my memory.  Boyfriend, mom, handcuffs things like that.  I have discontinued reading a few historical romance books with in the first few chapters because the author was using modern words.  But I didn't feel the ones used were a deal breaker as it felt a lot more authentic to the time than a few slip ups.

The other thing I found slightly irritating, and I am by far the grammar police. But there were quite a number of places that a coma would have made it easier to read.  I had to go back and re-read those sentences because they didn't make much sense without the coma.  As strange as that sounds, at least for me it was only a small issue.  But there were some misspelled words, and Im not a perfect speller by any means either.  But a few other sentences didn't make sense because words were left out.  But it was easy to fill in those missing words and make sense of the sentence.  I know this book most likely wasn't professionally proofed and I respect that as well.  I just wanted to mention those things for those that find these small issues a deal breaker.  Sadly.. there are those out there that will rate a book a single star for a few such errors.  I fully respect Indy (independent) authors and actually prefer the many books that I have read and enjoyed that are only e-books rather than books that have actually gone through a publisher, professionally proof-red and are in print as well as available in the e-book kindle format.

The one other thing that bugged me, which I actually see quite often is this.  Maybe the author needs to do more research using childrens age appropriate speech as well as what they can and can and can-not do given their age.  Having three kids of my own I find it slightly annoying.  There were a number of these types of errors.  In one place toddlers would be quoted as speaking almost perfect sentences then later they are quoted as speaking broken sentences with sounded out words and as if spoken with a youngsters type lisp as a toddler does when they are first learning to speak or has lost a tooth.

The last thing that I would make a suggestion for this author (or any other reading this) as I plan on reading any more of your historical work is to use a written time-line on a piece of paper.  Have your dates and months and ages of children written down.  As well as the ages of children when you say specifically x-x-x time has passed.  I found the time-line to be WAY off in this series and was frustrating a few times.  But again, not a deal breaker for me.

I did finish book 4 of this series after I read book 3.  But given book 4 is a collaboration between two authors I wasn't sure if I should read it after book 3 or go back and read the first three books of the Redemption series first.  But I did what I did.

Going back to the timeline above, I found book 4 very confusing in terms of reading about characters that are in the Redemption series but you haven't read that yet in reading book 4.  My mother use to write down characters names on a piece of paper with a dash followed by who they are in relation to who.  We have traded some books and her little cheat sheets were left in the books.  I have done this a time or two in reading books, and a cheat sheet at the beginning would have made reading book 4 a lot easier, rather than wait for them to be explained.  This is especially true with the two women that Tim lost in book 4 that is slightly written about in the beginning of the book.  Sorry no spoiler as that is info written in the description.  But in the end it all came out in the story line and was clearly explained, but in the beginning it was rather confusing.  Just be aware of that if you do what I did and read book 4 before the first 3 books of the other series.

IF THE AUTHOR READS THIS, PLEASE UPDATE THE DESCRIPTION to let readers know the best order to read these two series as they are by two authors yet intermingle with characters a bit.

Ive just a few chapters into the 1st book of the Redemption series and I wanted to make this review before I continue with this series because its by a different author.  The same author in the collaboration book 4.

Knowing what I do know, I believe I wish I had read the Redemption series (even though I am just a few chapters into the 1st book) first before reading book 4.  The only reason is because of the blend of the characters would have made it much easier to understand book 4.

After I was done with book 4 in a 5 book series I looked high and low for book 5.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  At the end of book 4 there is an epilogue or rather a teaser into book 5.  But I couldn't find this book on the Author Sophie Dawsons page.  At the end of this teaser it says To be continued in Redeeming Time: Book 5 of the Redemption series.

Well if you are having issues finding this mysterious book 5 like I did, you might try the other authors page.  George H McVey and the book is called Redeeming Character.  At the point of writing this review I haven't read this book yet, as I plan on reading the first three books of this series first.  I haven't decided if I am going to re-read book 4 or not.  Time will tell  But book 5 is the continuation of book 4, from what I gather reading the description and knowing what I do about how book 4 ends.  But I want to learn more about these characters before I continue with book 5.",Must Read & Read Series In Order,2,12/1/2016
1023,5,A1ZQGKKF2I7YS0,B00A92RFPM,"I do not like War Stories.  I do not like books which have specific violence.  I loved this very well written book.

A young man is going on an Honor Flight with his great-grandfather.  The young man is on his way to serve in Afghanistan.  During the flight the two men get to know one another and Mack begins to tell his great- grandson about his war.  During World War II, Mack was in a very special unit.  And it was made up of very special men.

We get to hear about the Twins, Big Swede, TinPan, Petey, Jackson, Donovan and Cap and many more.  Most of all we get to hear about human beings who were asked to do terrible things and risk their lives while doing those things.

This is not just any war story.  Yes, the background is a huge war, but this is a story of young men.  They are funny and brave and strong and weak but most of all they are very human.  Even though I knew it would not be possible, I wanted every one of them to live happily ever after.  That did not happen.

I have read enough history to know that what happens in this book is very likely the kind of thing which happened in World War II.

Dan McCurrigan is a new to me author.  When he writes another book, I want to read it.

I am normally extra gentle if I review a new author.  I want to encourage new talent.  This new author does not need anything from me.  He is a very good writer.

The writing was great, very descriptive and detailed. The history was well researched and the characters were developed, sharp-edged and varied. The editing could have been better.  I also noticed an overall theme of sexual coercion that ran through out all three books.
Book 1, Fierce Eden, was a 5 star read. The customs and exploits were interesting, fast and exciting. The romance was steamy, but not overly explicit. The heroine was courageous and feisty and the hero eventually caught up to his own greatness. The ending was perfect.
Book 2, Louisiana Dawn, is a 3 star read. Again, the heroine was brave and spunky, but the hero was not likable. The pace as a little slower, but this book had a bit more mystery. The ending was ok.
Book 3, Embrace and Conquer, was a 2 star read. It was divided into two parts. The first part was very dark and disturbing because of the times, but also because the hero was actually beyond redemption, even to the point of. The second part was a little better, but I still had a hard time finishing it. I was annoyed by the heroines emotional weaknesses in this book as much as in the second book.

1045,2,A1S0ZB2OZYAFDO,B00AA3P7M8,"I started this series hoping it would be a long series that would provide some beach reading for the summer. I had some trepidation about such a long series. Ive read some that were great and I wanted them to keep going indefinitely. But some others have become painfully repetitious and pointless. This one seems like it will fall somewhere in between. It wasn't painfully bad, but it was far from the most engaging book Ive ever read and continuing with the series is not a given for me.

My biggest problem with it is the same problem I have with a lot of less-than-superstar authors. There is very little in the way of character development or plot expos through the writing/prose. So the author resorts to hitting me over the head with it using dialog. She hasn't written  or hasn't been able to write  a believable romance through her prose, so there is invariably a conversation, often repeated conversations, with the dialog telling me Youre in love, Hes in love, Youre destined to be together, blah blah blah. That would never happen with Kathy Reichs, Linda Fairstein, Tess Gerritsen, Stuart Woods or dozens of other authors of long-running series.

Another red flag for me at the beginning of a series is the number of central characters. In this case, there are the core 4 girlfriends and at least that many secondary characters. It isn't that any of them are so important to the story  they arent, they are peripheral at best. But they are thrust to the front in order to provide fodder for following books in the series. Again, that would never happen with better authors. Its been Coop, Mike and Mercer through 18 Linda Fairstein books, Stone and Dino through 38 Stuart Woods books, Tempe and Ryan through 18 Kathy Reichs books, Jane and Maura through 11 Tess Gerritsen books, etc. But writing like that requires more careful and detailed plot development that I see in this book.

Last, there is the quality of writing. The book reads like it was written by a high schooler. It wanted to be an adult romance and tried to be, but so much of it sounded and felt like high school kids playing the parts. The characters bounded from one silly, immature misunderstanding to another and rarely acted like responsible business-owning adults. But then, the misunderstandings were solved and smoothed over in 3 sentences. It was so unbelievable.

As I said, it was far from great, but wasn't the worst Ive ever read. So Im willing to give the 2nd book a try. If that one doesnt improve, then Im done and won't continue with the series.",Far from great - I'll give the series one more chance,2,6/20/2016

Loved by the whole town, her dad was always the one she could count on, and now shes left to figure out the family business on her own.  But her best friends aren't leaving her to loneliness and solitude, and the man who stole her heart before disappearing years ago is back and looking to make amends.

Judging Covers:  I thought the previous covers for this series were great, but it seems someone has decided to give them an unnecessary and inferior makeover.  Now the heroine looks like shes maybe fourteen years old, and the way-too-bright title is a mess.  Had this been the cover when I first picked up the book Well, I doubt Id have picked it up in the first place.

The Verdict:  The story started out strong, with Amanda grieving the untimely death of the father she was so close to, and just as shes starting to fall apart, her best friends from her younger years show up to help her through it.  Theyve been scattered to different states and careers for years now, but their friendship hasn't faded, and they bring some much needed love and levity to an otherwise depressing situation.

However, Jason Barnes has now returned as well.  Once her fathers right hand man, not to mention the guy who stole her heart years ago, Jasons back after disappearing in the dead of night, and if hes going to make things right with Amanda, hes got tons of work to do.  Not only is she going through a tough time, but shes not so sure she can trust her heart to Jason again.

This is the first book by Melanie Shawn that Ive read, and if I remember correctly, I picked it up in a freebie sale here on Amazon, so while I hoped it would be good, it wasn't something I was absolutely dying to read.  But once Id finished a few other books, I opened it up and didn't put it down.  Classic plot, brilliant characterizations, and enough laughter to temper the emotional drama that romance novels bring.  Amandas friends were fun, a mix of personalities and lifestyles that kept things interesting, and both Amanda and Jason were very easy to understand and relate to.  Jasons personal story was especially compelling, and I loved the way the authors didn't resort to trite caricatures and instead delivered characters that, despite their shortcomings, I couldn't help but root for.

Melanie Shawn is one of my favorite authors and I love the Hope Falls characters.

Amanda fell in love with Justin when she was 5 and he began working for her dad when he was 10.  At 16 he moved onto the ranch after his abusive father went too far. But an event and misunderstanding when he was 23 and Amanda was 18 caused Justin to leave without notice.  It about broke Amanda beyond repair. Now Justin is back for the reading of her father's will and Amanda may not be prepared for what is coming.

Justin did the right thing by keeping his hands off of the only girl he ever loved years ago but now he's back for the reading of her father's will. Parker Jacobs very well may have saved his life when he was just a kid and now he's back in Hope Falls, shocked after hearing the reading of Parker's will.  It looks like he and Amanda will be tied together for at least the foreseeable future. Will they be able to get past the hurt and misunderstandings from almost 10 years ago?

If you have ever gone to college, or even considered it, the base of the story revolves around that first collegiate year. Of course we learned a lot about ourselves, others, and made an independent stand. However, the chaos, the sleuthing, and the depth  of things extracurricular make this writer stand out. Hilarious thoughts, acts, observations, and craziness are multiplied by as many new friends Rachel meets this year. But love?

1063,5,A1IY6C3ZGOLTLX,B00AABHU70,"I am absolutely in LOVE with this series!  I am on book 7 of the Rachael OBrian Chronicles now, and can't stop, but I wanted to head back and do some reviews starting at book #1.  This series is set starting in 1986 when the heroine goes to college-- I started in 1985.  No cell phones, no computers essentially, it is really a fun series to read.  Rachael OBrien is a funny girl with an eidetic memory, that comes in handy, but isn't overused in the series.  She makes friends pretty easily, and is a good friend who happens to run into some precarious situations. With a family interest in fine art and restorations, Rachael is pursuing a degree in Art History in NC.  Her adventures take place here, at home in Ohio, and sometimes on Spring Break with her friends.

Paisley Ray has a beautifully visually style of writing.  I can see every action and setting, as if I were watching a movie.  Her characters are well written and easy to visualize.  So far, each one has maintained their uniqueness although they do grow from Book 1 (Freshman Year) to Book 7 (Senior Year).  They are hilarious and get into plenty of messes of their own.

I am uncertain of the negative reviewsespecially those who never got past the 1st quarter of the book-- but yes, this IS about a College Girl.  They do go out drinking, but it isn't promoting drinking, just telling the story of college in the 80s.  The drinking age was 18, switching to 21.  I thought there was so much more to the story that it being about 18 year-old antics.  Well, it was set in the characters Freshman year of college, so Im not sure what you expected??

The most amazing part to me is how well Ms. Ray kept to the right clothing, cars, language, etc. for the 80s.  It isn't easy, but Ive only seen one glaring error so far. Well done and so charmingly retro for those of us who lived it back then.
This series is a bit mystery, some nostalgia for some of us and a hint of romance but 100% clean reading in the romance department.  If you are looking for an enjoyable series to relax with, Rachael O'Brien is the gal you want to be with.

I found this series via Bookbub, and read the subsequent titles using Amazons Kindle Unlimited, which unfortunately doesnt count paying a monthly subscription to borrow their books as Verified Purchases yet.","Hilariously Nostalgic Series!

I hate giving up on a book, but this one I'm not going to finish. I started out amused by the main character but as the story progressed, I lost interest. The tension lacked, and the chapters seemed to be circular with no forward motion to the story. The main character is sex-focused (not a bad thing but it's almost ridiculous how the author leaves you hanging in that aspect...and I'm not a supporter of casual sex.), and she's a push-over. I struggled to find something in the main character that was lovable---why should I care?

1066,3,AZULU4TOTOLEU,B00AABHU70,"This was my first experience with this writer, and I must say that I was disappointed.  The premise of the series held promise, particularly for me, as the main character is from Ohio (like me) and is in college in the 80s (also like me). Granted, she is going to college in the South, while I stayed in the Buckeye State, but I presumed I would still enjoy the story and feel some connection to her.

First of all, it seemed that Rachel and her ""friends"" (more on them later) were more interested in parties, drugs, alcohol and sex than in getting their education. And those activities even overshadowed the mystery of the art fraud.

As for the ""friends,"" I was turned off by the way they treated her throughout the book. People who take you somewhere you've never been before and then basically ditch you, on more than one or two occasions, are not your friends. Rachel needs to wise up and move on.

And then there were the spelling and grammar errors. As a former teacher, those had me cringing throughout the entire book. ""Loose"" and ""lose"" mean two different things, and are not interchangeable. And the phrase is ""eau de cologne""  NOT ""ode de cologne""!

It is an easy read, and it gave me a few laughs, but I won't be reading any further in the series.

1077,2,A30WJKGX1XG19Q,B00AB05RRU,"It started off really good and I enjoyed the way the two characters met.  Then it went downhill.  The Hero (Griffin) risks his life to save the Heroine's (Clare) daughter and asks for nothing in return.  Then the next day in town when the townspeople are spreading malicious rumors about him (which didn't make a lot of sense - and there was no real reason why) Clare doesn't even stand up for him.  She thinks well I have to live in this town so no need to make my life harder.  (Let's not forget that Griffin could have done the same and left her stranded on the side of the road and not gone out of his way to rescue her daughter).  I really didn't like Clare after this.  She was spineless and selfish.  I also didn't quite get why she had never even been on a date in the last 15 years since her husband died.  The author never really gave me a reason for this.  Clare decided to never date/be in a relationship because her husband was leaving her when he died.  It also read like she wasn't that in love with her husband but married him because she was pregnant.  So why the huge heartache and NEVER getting involved.  Griffin had his issues as well.  He blamed his ex-wife for everything even though he was obviously not a good husband or father.  His ideas about parenting were absurd and he believed he could buy his daughter's love and got upset when he couldn't.

The writing was actually good (except the glaring error where she said she met her best friend 3 years ago and then best friend talked about when she told her she'd just met her husband which was 15 years ago).  The teens were realistic and added to the story.  The town was entertaining although not terribly believable.  The HEA was just okay - I didn't really buy the decision the hero made at the end because it was a complete turn around that happened way to fast.

There to oversee her twin brother, Kyles, renovation of their parents home, she is also reconnecting with old high school friends. Immediately, though, a decade-old tragedy, the death in a boating accident of a friend and almost-boyfriend, intrudes. At a party, shes approached by Jeff, witness to the old death, who wants to talk to her about it. She also finds herself pursued by a teenaged neighbor who had an old crush on her and seems to want to revive it.
When Jeff is found dead at the base of a cliff, Belinda knows something is amiss. She finds it hard to concentrate on it, however, because of the heat emitted by Bennett Tate, an ex-cop turned event security expert, who is asked by a friend on the local police force to keep an eye on hera task he finds most pleasant.
Things go from bad to worse, and Belinda finds herself the target of some weird attempts on her life, her brother accused of murdering Jeff, and an old classmate still carrying a grudge over something that is ten years in the past.
You might assume Cliffhanger by Amy Saunders is one of those books that ends on a cliffhanger, with manyor at least the mainissues unresolved. Wrong. The author wraps everything up nicely. Turns out, the title refers to the situations the main character constantly finds herself in.
One complaint about the book. The author uses characters names frequently, and I do mean frequently. Belindas name opens the first two paragraphs, and I stopped counting how many times her name was used in that chapter at tenit was more. Its nice to know which character is which, but there has to be a better way than using their name; three or four times in one paragraph is way too many. At that frequency its not informative, its intrusive.
So, heres a book with a fascinating couple of main characters, the requisite volume of sparks flying between them, and a fairly interesting plotmarred by names, names, names. I give it three stars, and cross my fingers that this authorwho shows great promisewill notice this and institute corrective measures in future books.","Flawed, but not fatally so - a sort of fun read",2,6/7/2017

When one of her classmates suddenly turns up dead, Belinda teams up with security expert, Bennett Tate.

1088,1,A2JQPZ3YFSYY0X,B00ACVHCX0,"After reading all the rave reviews, I was really disappointed in this book. First of all, if you're going to publish a book, cook/recipe or not, is it too much to ask that you edit it? I definitely got the impression different people wrote each recipe; the writing style and manner differed from page to page. And how, might I ask, do you measure 1 1/2 cups of chicken breast? It doesn't say dice it and measure, just add 1 1/2 cups of chicken breast... Okie dokie then. Then lets mosey on over to the stroganoff recipe...(#30 in table of contents). Ingredients are listed, with no delineation between them, (all lumped together in one list). It says to add the beef and next 8 ingredients... blah blah... then the directions are so confusing, I think perhaps it was either translated poorly, or whoever wrote it does not speak English natively. There is some attempt at humor that falls flat... <crickets chirping>. All in all, there are perhaps 2 or 3 recipes that are either unique or original. Crockpot lasagna? Sure! but it's nothing special or unique, just basic meatsauce with cheese and noodles layered. Hmmmm, yep. Or better yet, Chicken with Dumplings? Cut up chicken breast, add it to Cream of Chicken (canned condensed) soup.... cook... add refrigerated biscuit dough cut into chunks...cook. Wow! Who'd a thunk that idear up??? I do not open a cookbook looking for recipes instructing me to open a can of this and add it to a can of that... I can find enough of that s**** on the back of Campbell's soup cans.  I'm so disappointed in this book, as I'm writing this review I'm dropping of another star. It's ridiculous. Get some original ideas, learn to write and EDIT before you publish. There are some parts of this book that are quite well written, it is just not consistent. I did receive this book at a reduced or free cost in exchange for my honest review and opinion. If this book is free, it cost too much. I was majorly disappointed and am deleting it off my Kindle now.",Huge disappointment; waste of time...,5,2/11/2016
1089,5,A20UPXC78AG73V,B00ACVHCX0,"When I first began reading, I skimmed through the table of contents to get a better idea of which recipes Id definitely like to try immediately. I have a house of 5 people, myself, my husband, our 2 young children, plus my disabled brother in law, and with the chaos, slow cooked meals are great on my sanity and stress levels. :)

At the end of the table of contents, there is a link for the Top Rated Slow Cookers, which takes you to the end of the book, and lists 5 slow cookers, and lists their prices and features. I may be saving up my money to invest in a new slow cooker after this.

I especially liked the 5 Bright Ideas Section, where I found a few helpful tips that I had never known. I normally just throw a bunch of stuff in my crock pot and let it go. Little did I know that these tips help me save cooking time, prep time and helping my food taste so much better. Im definitely going to apply these in my slow cooker recipes from now on.

The thing I love about these recipe eBooks, is that I can simply click on something in the table of contents and it takes me there in a flash, unlike printed cookbooks, which take up more space on the counter, and the pages get dirty with greasy fingerprints when turning the pages in the middle of cooking. Im also able to do a quick web search on any terms/words that I am not familiar with in a recipe. LOVE IT!

Most of these recipes feed anywhere between 4-8 people. Most of these recipes I would cut in half, as my young children and I eat like birds, where the guys eat a bit more. Either way, itll work out perfectly.

For the purpose of this review, I will share my experience with Recipe 34. Moms Best Meaty Lasagna. I have halved the recipe, since my family doesnt eat quite that much, and also because my crock pot is too small for the entire recipe. I have shared photos of some of the process, and of course, the finished lasagna.

I have never made lasagna in a crock pot before, so this is an exciting new experience for me.

It ended up being a hit! Even though I halved the recipe, it fed both the guys in the house, both of my picky bird eater children finished their plates, and I was able to share the large amount left over with my neighbors (family of 4). Yum!! Great recipes! Can't wait to make more!

Whenever a contraction for ""it would"" or any other phrase with ""would"" as the second word is in the dialog, instead of ""it'd"", whomever transcribed the book into eform typed ""it'ld"".

When referring to money (English or Australian pounds) in numeric form, the transcriber would type "" #2,500 "", instead of "" 2,500 "".

Any word that should have an e with an accent mark over it would have a { instead. So, ""cafe'"" appears as ""caf{"".

Worst of all, anything that should be in italics, such as a newspaper name, or stressed words in dialog are typed as ""_New York Times_"" or ""I am _so_ glad everyone is alright.""

Liam is this kind of a guy, you can almost hear the tone of his voice, i felt instantly connected.
Awesome....<3
I will start to say...(because there is no other room in my review to say it load and clear) :
It was HOT,  not just a hot read but HOT.... (Only it's so much more then that)

Liam....Introducing himself shortly how his life gets from sixteen till now thirty eight. How he had a child at seventeen. How he worked his ass off to support him. How he finally can generate money with the p o r n industry. How he met Seth, seven years younger and the love of his life. How he left the love of his life four years a go.

He has an appointment with his twenty one year old son. Who has something to discuss with him. Kel wants Liam to meet his boyfriend.
What happened then is indeed beyond complicated......

Bit by bit we get to know why he left the love of his life and Jesus F* Christ that was......devastating....It's so damn raw I cried and cursed hard and loud...

Liam loves Seth and Kel deeply and they love him even more.
The triangle works just fine inside the bedroom but outside it almost doomed to failure.
They have the hottest s e x you can dream of and it works, they love each other hard.
Only life is harder.

But....even with all the hotness there is a real story. Bit by bit we get to know how all the pieces of the puzzle fits together. What happened twenty one years ago, what happened during those twenty one years and what happened four years ago.....

This story....told from Liam's pov ......it's so much worse than you can imagine...... so damn harsh and so extended. Nothing is what it seems.

Liam's personality is developed very well, his attitude, his flaws, his weakness and his strength. I loved him from the first page. Seth loves Liam hard and was so lost when he disappeared....I felt so sorry for him..... and there is Kel....beautiful Kel, with a big heart, mature and sexy as hell, you have to love him.
Saying it's complicated is an understatement, at the end it was somewhat to much .....to much drama and story.  Nevertheless it was captivating as hell.

What confused me were the moments I thought they had it all together but then it still felt apart. My faith in them for a future together shrank a bit. But there is always hope....

Very well written and fascinating, damn hot heartbreaking story.

The story is intriguing, the questions that are raised and the situations that the main antagonist attempts to engineer are plausible and relevant to modern life. However, the book suffers greatly from Mad Lib syndrome. For those who don't know, a Mad Lib is a story with missing words. Each missing word is left for the player to choose, using the part of speech indicated. For example this sentence is a Mad Lib: The _________ (adjective) inspector ate ______________ (noun, food) for breakfast. One person would call out the part of speech and the other person would provide a word to fill in the blank, without knowing the context it would be used in. Many, many sentences in this book are like this. It is most obvious with the adjectives, but honestly, I think every part of speech got a turn. As you can imagine, this slowed the plot down considerably, because I repeatedly had to stop and try to determine exactly what the author was trying to say.
Related to Mad Lib syndrome is I'm So Posh syndrome. I personally think of this as having an ""ounce of pretension,"" which as everyone who's seen Steel Magnolias knows, is worth a pound of manure. So many places throughout the book a convoluted and nearly ridiculous description is provided when a simple sentence would have been so much more clear. In other places, in what seems to be an effort to seem intelligent and mysterious, information is omitted leaving the reader confused. Several times I found myself paging back trying to find a piece of information I missed because the passage I was trying to read made no sense.
Overall, I actually did enjoy the book. I would strongly recommend that the author hire a ruthless editor and not take personal offense when the novel is slashed to perhaps 60% of its current size. Furthermore, I think the book would then benefit from a reading group to shape and refine much of the dialogue.

Rebecca is in Hawaii doing research on how hotels operate before deciding whether or not to open an inn back in Canela, Texas. When they meet, Doug suggests they share his honeymoon package - plantonically, of course. It would be a shame for it to go to waste. When the week is over, they go their separate ways - Doug to Detroit; Rebecca to Canela. But is that the end for them?

Willing suspension of disbelief is necessary here; don't go into this series thinking that you are going to be reading actual accounts of anything.

I feel the characters are developed, the plot is well written and the crazy stuff these guys get into is just great. I don't care that many of the stunts they pull are unreal. I loved MacGyver also and he did some really crazy things that I'm quite certain are not possible. For me, I was able to read this book and have vivid visualizations of what was happening (to the best of my understanding without stopping to research a few things).

Is it all believable? No! Why would you want that? That's what regular life is for, and also non-fiction books.
Is it enjoyable? Yes, as long as you go into it looking to enjoy a read.

There are some mistakes in the text; what you also need to understand is that indie authors don't benefit from publishing house editors. Can you get past them? You should be able to.

1118,3,A838JWHMQK5RW,B00ALUF3QK,"I read this book because I liked the characters, but I did not like the plot.  The heroine's reason for marrying was for the money and experience of taking care of a dying maniac; she wanted to build a hospital and be a medical professional.

The hero simply wanted to not die alone and he was physically attracted to her...(dying?  let's just shag his way to the end: leaving an heir and a hospital while dying with the proverbial smile on his ace).

The family wanted them together for various reasons, only Bertie Trent was altruistic and he was labeled dumb as a post. Bertie was my favorite character.

Too much emphasis on the illness. It seemed to be fifty percent and that was boring, boring, boring....but if you like being a medical detective, it may appeal.  Unfortunately, it is not a deep mystery.

Finally, the romance was odd, they met and married and consummated the marriage within 48hours; not a lot of time for tension building up and all the fun stuff that you usually read a romance for; the main conflict was whether he would die in two or six months.

I never understood some of the mysteries; medical or otherwise,  put forth and I really couldn't understand why the hero thought that he was a pervert.....he seemed like a nice guy stuck in a ho-hum book.  The  heroine was mostly unhappy that she was not a doctor and very happy that she got to make love to the stranger she married.

One of the most unique aspects of this book is the way that the author dispatched with the family in order to make him the head of the family in need of an heir.  A couple of efficient paragraphs and what usually take a chapter is completed.  I gave the book three instead of two stars simply bc of the unique disbursement of his family.  I would have given it four, perhaps if his mom had not died so tragically and inefficiently.

FIVE STARS
This is the first book in the Mountains trilogy.  Phoebe Alexander has written a five star book!! I am so in love with her writing and the honesty and dept of it.  This book is by no means intended or appropriate for anyone under the age of 18.  So please mature audiences only.
In this book Phoebe Alexander jumps right in with the main character Sarah, a 36 year old single mom to a teenage daughter and an adolescent son.  She is also a college professor with a PhD in Sociology.
Sarah loves to study people and their interactions with each other as well as observe them.  Not only that but she is highly sexual and enjoys sex.  There is quite the controversay in her lifestyle yet she is upfront and honest with those that she chooses to spend her time with.  She also doesn't flaunt her actions in front of her children or her family.
Phoebe Alexander writes about finding that someone that just fulfills everything you ever though you wouldnt need again and how you never plan to have to look for it again yet it slips through your fingers.  No matter how strong of a woman you are, it does destory part of you.
No matter the choices that have been made there is always a chance to say "" I was wrong, can we try again?""  Sarah finds herself wanting that opportunity.
Finding yourself and realizing what it is that you truly want in life only to learn that you may have lost it just moments before you woke up.  Heartbreaking and devistating.  But seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and hoping for another chance.
Phoebe Alexander makes you go back and forth between two love interests in this book and honestly i don't know what I would have done in Sarah's shoes.  All I know is I can't wait for the next book to come out so that I can see if things hopefully work out in her favor.

5 out of 5 stars

The story Mountains Wanted (Mountains Trilogy Book 1) by Phoebe Alexander is a transgender/military romance book. Dr. Sarah Lynde is a sociology professor and single mother of two. She is very open minded when it comes to sexual adventures. She knows she doesnt want a relationship. Then she meets Army First Sergeant James McAllister. With him, she experiences a connection like she never has before. For the first time, she starts to question what she really wants.

This is the first book in a trilogy and is told from Sarahs eyes. I have read erotic romance books before however, this is one of the most intense. As the story progresses you are struck by strong emotions and I would find myself switching between disbelief, sadness, happiness, and frustration within a short period of time. Sometimes I was so frustrated by James that I wanted to scream. He would seem not to care about Sarah and then in the next moment he was telling her she was so special. He seems to be so conflicted and unsure of what he really wants. Sarah is an awesome character. She is a strong, independent woman who has learned to make her own way in life. She is divorced and has two children that she is raising. She always deals head on with any situation that comes up. She is very open-minded and is adventurous when it comes to sex. She has a best friend, Rachel, who is always there for her and if one of them needs help the other drops everything. I have to say that when I first read the description of this story I wasn't sure what to expect. Once I read the first couple of chapters it got so that I couldn't put the book down for very long. I just had to know that happened next. I highly recommend reading it. This book does have adult language and as it is an erotic romance book very hot love scenes. It is for those 18 years or older.",she experiences a connection like she never has before,3,2/23/2017

Be prepared to lose some sleep...you will not want to book this book down. Also, you'll want to read when you won't be interrupted, because there are several hawt, hawt, hawt moments. Along with all that steam is friendship, humor, discovery, acceptance, heartache, hope and love. I have such a book hangover and can not wait to get my hands on Mountains Climbed.

Sarah and Rachel are best friends and have a unique relationship ...I loved the writing that was done with these characters. I felt like I was hanging out with them and part of their shenanigans. They have a special bond and respect for one another.

Sarah is a single parent who is a professor at the university. Sarah loves teaching and has known since she was a child that it was her calling. She loves connecting with others and is a huge communicator herself. During one of her presentation she eyed a man in the audience and had a hard time looking away. Afterwards he approached Sarah and she learned who he was. James McAllister is a instructor in the ROTC program and was in attendance with his students.

Sarah and James are completely different in so many ways as well as their upbringing. James was raised very traditionally, had a catholic education and is part of a big family. Sarah was raised by a single parent and tends to be very accepting of others, their sexuality, values and whatever makes them happy and authentic. Yet somehow she feels a bond that she never felt with another soul. Sarah doesn't do exclusive or traditional relationships and has two children. James is looking for his soulmate to raise a family with.

It's amazing how people come into your life and journey with you for a while, and then one or both of you outgrow each other and move on. There's a reason they're there and things happen the way they do, but sometimes you don't know what the reason is until much further down the road.",Mountains Wanted,12,2/23/2017
1131,4,A1KMMNTZBRWOWM,B00AN9907W,"I am truly not sure where to begin. This book has enveloped me in so many emotions and so much thought looking at my own life. Mountains Wanted by Phoebe Alexander is absolutely a story that need only be read by those with an open mind. It touches on subjects that many people would never dream to talk about. But really that's what I liked about it. It was very honest and raw with emotion, love and people.

Alexander put a lot of thought into her character of Sarah. The way that she rationalizes things in her head and explains them with social theories shows that a great deal of research was put into this book. Which I love! While it does dive into unconventional relationships, it is not over the top, just informative via what seems like real life. Alexander allows the personality of each of her characters show during every interaction they have with another.

Dr. Sarah Lynde is a 36 year old sociology professor and single mother of two wonderful children, Abby and Owen. Due to her extensive research on sexuality, gender and unconventional relationships she has become very open and fluid with her relationships with people. She fully believes that one is capable of loving more than one person and should not have to limit themselves and that it is acceptable to be open to both men and women, love is love after all and that is what she wants, to be loved.

James McAllister is a 29 year old headstrong, conservative Army First Sergeant who is well beyond his years in many ways but still shows his boyish charm. The oldest of 3 and an Army brat to boot, he is in charge of the ROTC program at the university Sarah teaches at. He engages Sarah at a discussion panel over a topic of sexuality in the military. After a casual coffee date they find their chemistry is beyond surreal. He eventually explains to her that he wants the cookie cutter American family, house, wife, kids; while Sarah suggests that she only wants to be friends with benefits. She ends up finding that her feelings for James are deeper than she allowed herself to believe; ""Does James feel the same way about Sarah? Or will her exploration of sexuality be too much for his conservative upbringing?

This is truly a story of passion. Not only between Sarah and James but Sarah in all of her other relationships as well. With her other boyfriend, with her best friend Rachel, with people she encounters at parties, though it is not all about sex even if there is a lot of it. I will admit, it started slow for me and took me awhile to get into but you need to get inside Sarah's mind to understand the story. While the author does allow two characters to have internal thoughts or words in the same paragraph, it is not hard to follow. I am anxious to read the rest of the trilogy because there are so many unanswered questions.",But really that's what I liked about it,2,2/23/2017

Jack owns and operates a gym, but he is also a Dom at the local bar/dungeon. He notice Kristy when she bought her gym membership a couple of years ago, but she never seemed interested in him. Imagine his joyful surprise when Kristy is introduced to his masked persona, Master Jay as a virgin newbie who wants to explore the BDSM lifestyle. If only she was as interested in him as he is in her.

Overall, I really enjoyed Kristy and Jack's story in The Silken Edge by Laci Paige. They are both likable characters with an understandable problem of how to merge their two different lifestyles. How they finally come up with a compromise that they both can live with adds a bit of a twist to this engaging and unusual romance.",A BDSM romance with an unusual twist.,2,3/10/2017

Her best friend is living the 'life' and after a few bumps in the road she decides to try as well. I did think her character was a bit too forgiving. Jake is several years younger than her and it is issue for her but not for him or anyone else.  There is language and sex and heat and an HEA. I didn't find it too over the top.

In college I read Justine, and can state for a fact that I never want to read the thoughts of any human being who gets off on causing others pain.  People who do are criminals, and should be locked up.  This author went to great pains to explain BDSM as an alternate life style, and I understand why it is so appealing - IF done with love and consideration for the other person.  That ""safe/sane/considerate"" warning was repeated several times.  And for these characters in these situations, the BDSM lifestyle worked.  The level of trust that developed between them was sensual and tender, and their emotional needs were being met, some times for the first time in their adult lives.  Watching, reading their thoughts and feelings, you realise that they were growing and maturing, and I couldn't help but be happy for them.  It's a great story, well told, and the characters are complex, and yet so believable I had a hard time putting it down.  Like a good mystery, you can't wait to see how it all turns out.  This first book in the series is free on Amazon, so why not try it and see what you think?  You might surprise yourself.

1145,5,A34YZ56BSCN93B,B00ANG0812,"The Silken Edge is the first book in the Silken Edge Series and my first book by Laci Paige, and all I have to say is this book was OMG AMAZING. I started reading, and I couldn't put it down. It kept me captivated from the first sentence to the last; I just had to keep reading to find out what happened next. I loved all of the twists and turns. I loved seeing BDSM through the eyes of a woman who is completely convinced that she isn't into kink, only to find out that not only is she into it but that she is a switch also. I loved how Jake / Master Jay has to get used to dealing with his feelings and I loved getting to see him struggle with them. I loved their vanilla week and especially the scene where Kristy is a Dom for the first time with Jake. I would definitely recommend this book. I cant wait to read the next book in the series. I received this book in exchange for an honest review.

Here is a synopsis for The Silken Edge. After her longtime boyfriend dumps her, Kristy craves a change in her life. Her best friend, Sherry, is into the BDSM scene, and on a whim and a bet, Kristy finds herself in the playroom at an exclusive club. A disguised Dom named Master Jay uses sensation play and a piece of silk to help her discover the world of kink. She finds it enjoyable and addictive, but what she doesnt know is that Master Jay is really Jake, a much younger man to whom shes strongly attracted. For the past couple of years, Jake quietly watched Kristy in his gym. He doesnt care that shes older than him; he wants her. When the virgin BDSM sub hes hired to train ends up being Kristy, Jake almost falls apart. During the scene they play at the club, he fantasizes about getting her into restraints in his own playroom. But Kristy is shocked when she learns that the two men she desires are one and the same. Can Kristy whos led a vanilla sex life, and Jake, who knows nothing but kink, find a future together?",I Couldn't Put It Down!!!,6,3/18/2016
1146,2,ADNOKER52SCQ,B00ANG0812,"Starting with the whole break up of longtime boyfriend who she lived with...way too easily dealt with as well as the immediate transition into feelings for new, young, gym trainer....  I'm thinking the writer wanted the characters to seem mature because of their ages, but it was more like they were immature and shallow.

The BDSM premise and scenes needed to be way more researched and thought out.  I'm guessing because of the FSOG craze at the time this book was written it was thought up to sell but not thought out to be believable or real.  So much wrong in so many ways.

This book had all kinds of potential for May/December romances, but these characters weren't written to pull even that off well.

As for the writing...places were good and others very stilted.  It would flow until it wouldn't.  The BDSM scenes may have cut it for a vanilla romance with some kinky exploration, but not for a BDSM book.  The club didn't even cut it for this to be a book about BDSM romance.

Hopefully, in the future the writer will research this a lot better if more romance with this subgenre is going to be the focus.

It wasn't until after I had been asked to read this and provided a copy by the author for review that it has been out for several years with a lot of reviews on the positive side. Even without reading those reviews I would hazard a guess that they are written with the whole love of Christian and Anastasia romance still fresh in everyone's minds.  Now that that craze has faded somewhat, those reviewers may reconsider their fanfction jump at the BDSM hype so popular during the time this book was published.

As I said, this book was provided to me by the author for an honest review.",I must have missed something.,5,3/17/2016
1147,5,AMQ8EI0M0ZMN7,B00ANZ1JWA,"I've reviewed all these books separately but the best way to read them is back to back. It's a great series and one I highly recommend. The first book I originally gave 4 stars and books 2 and 3 each were given 5 stars. I have no problem giving this series the whole 5 stars. Great value!

#1: is a really good series. This first one seemed a bit raw, like the author is maybe not too experienced yet (I'm not sure if this is one of her first books or not). It doesn't take away from the fact that it's a good story, a good mystery and the characters are very likable and well developed. And if you're a series fan, like me, there's nothing better than reading a series of books back to back to immerse yourself in the protagonist's life. This book has Rebekka Franck, journalist, on the trail of a murderer of wealthy men. She seems to be better at getting to the bottom of the connection of these men than the police do and she gets right in the middle of the investigation, along with her photographer, Sune. I would recommend this series for thriller/mystery readers. This wasn't my favorite of the series but it's still pretty good. Well deserving of the 4 stars.

#2: I've had this series sitting in my TBR pile ready to read for a while and I'm glad I finally got the time to read them. I'm halfway through now and I'm really enjoying the saga of protagonist Rebekka Franck, journalist. The author does a wonderful job of giving a great mystery, a good background story, and working on creating some really fleshed out characters. I could tell that the author had grown in her writing in this second book. I particularly liked this book as it had a psychological thriller edge to it. The whole who-done-it aspect kept me turning page after page while I lost track of time. If you like thrillers, particularly psychological thrillers, you should grab this book. Yes, you could even read this book as a stand alone, but I am recommending at least the first 3 books (all that I've read so far) as I'm really enjoying this series.

#3:  I've had this series on my TBR list for a couple years and finally have had time to read it. I am devouring it very quickly too as the saga of journalist Rebekka Franck is really good. The author has done a wonderful job of fleshing out her character, and the others, and it's fun to see how her personal story has grown in these first three books. The best part is the exciting thriller storylines that the author has come up with. Not for the squeamish at all! Yikes! This book starts out with a man called ""The Priest"" from a well-known cult dying a horrific death. How and why did this occur? And will Rebekka be able to pull more information from the very private people of the cult than the police have gotten so far? As more and more people die of these mysteries deaths, others start to become sick too. This book kept me on the edge of my seat and the pace was so fast that the book was over before I knew it. I'm finding that this author is good at hooking the reader into the story and not letting go until the end--something that I can't get enough of. Can't wait to dig into book #4. Another great addition to the series. Could very well be read as a stand alone but if you're a thriller fan, read them all!",Rebekka Franck Series 1-3,3,11/27/2016

Scott Nicholson, however, seems to have come up with a new one: In his novel ""After: The Shock"" a massive series of sunspots fries not only the electronic marvels we have come to depend upon so much but also the brains of many of the people who were not killed outright by them. It's an intriguing idea and there is actually a body of scientific research that supports that premise. In ""After,"" Nicholson draws upon that research to create a nightmare world in which ""Zapheads"" wander the landscape attacking and killing people - including other Zapheads - at random and with a frightening ferocity.
The survivors of this worldwide calamity are a confused bunch. Some are paranoid, others frightened, while still others are just trying to make it through another day without being clubbed to death by the seemingly mindless Zapheads. Told from multiple points of view, the novel focuses on Campbell, a former college student with not a lot going for him; Rachel, who finds her fundamentalist Christian faith wavering the longer she stays alive; and Jorge, a farm worker who is trying to protect his wife and daughter in a world that has spun out of control. As days turn into weeks these three characters encounter other survivors and some of them are worse than the Zapheads: Rogue soldiers with a peculiar view of the Zapheads (they see them as ""Enlightened"") and the power-hungry leader of a small group of people are among them but so, too, is a survivalist who takes Jorge and his family in when they are trying to escape from the wandering killers.
Nicholson has done a good job in fleshing out both his main and secondary characters in ""After,"" although I didn't always find their reactions to their altered circumstances as realistic as they might have been. In a world fraught with danger, some of them behave remarkably foolishly while others seem to have serious doubts about fighting back when they are threatened. I admit I might, as a former infantryman with a couple of combat tours under my belt, be projecting my own feelings in this case, but still...
Nicholson has done a good job in constructing a world that has spun into madness and his narrative flows along with few hitches. This is a fast read due, I think, to the author's ability to keep the story moving forward without long rambles into the meaning of life and other distractions. (There are, in fact, some rambles but they are not long and they blend into the story nicely.)
""After"" is the first book in a long series and, as such, it ends without resolution, which was a little disappointing to me. I'm not a big fan of cliffhangers, although that seems to be the trend in modern serial fiction. ""After"" doesn't exactly end on a cliffhanger but it does require that you buy at least one more book to find out what happens to the protagonists. I probably will do that, though I'll grumble at the fact I was forced to do so.","Sunspots, the Apocalypse, and ""Zapheads""",4,6/9/2016

And that's unfortunately just what it is. A novella. A SHORT story that doesn't allow for any real character development or relationship growth. Everything happens at a breakneck speed - which don't get me wrong is great if you like short stories, or you're just trying to kill an hour or two. However I couldn't really get into this one the way I have gotten into others.

That isn't to say there is anything wrong with the story other than what I've pointed out above. The author has a very smooth style, and the characters are likable enough - I just with there was more. I wish we learned exactly what it was about Alex that made Charlotte harbor a girlhood infatuation? At what point did love bloom between them? It just seemed like one minute he was seeing her for the first time (and struck by her beauty), then they were falling into bed together. Yes, be warned this novella does include a scene of a sexual nature that occurs out of wedlock.

Even with that, as I said above this story is a good way to kill an hour or two, and as it is merely an introduction to a new series, I do plan on checking out at least the next book (which is a full length) to see how the author is able to handle having more time to develop her story and characters.",It works if you have an hour or two to kill and aren't looking for a lot of substance.,2,1/23/2016

Bryce is the hero and I did not like him very much. His attitude was not one I like in a hero. Granted he had been through some traumatic incidents in his life, but it did not give him the right to act the way he did. He was too arrogant for my taste.

Fallon is a great character. I really liked her.  She was strong and was forced into being independent. She has a gift that is also a curse. Everyone around her has passed away in her life. Therefore it is no surprise that she's hesitant about displaying and expressing her feelings.

You feel like you're listening to a friendly uncle explain something in so easy a fashion that you wonder how you could not have understood this intuitively.  I have seen references to Fig. 1, Fig. 2, etc. and have not been led to the figures referenced; but the descriptions of what's in the figures is generally so complete that you can picture them in your mind.  I have spent my life with physics and engineering; but I have gotten some benefit by going back and reading this easy-to-understand book.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how the world works.

I will add that some of the material is dated.  Not the science, but things referenced in our lives, like an ear trumpet and references to balloon travel and to boys' and girls' activities -- this is a high school text book -- being, by today's standards, very gender oriented.  Girls sew and keep house or cook on a wood stove; boys go fishing, work on the farm or other manly (boyly?) things.  It's actually fun to see how different the world was when the first automobiles came out and the first airplanes flew.  And the science is about simple things and easier to understand without today's complexities entering into the picture.

The cover of my free book, thank goodness, was cartoonish and this new cover looks like a teen prom pic.

Sometimes there were up to three people talking in their heads. Very confusing and a big no-no in writing.

Now about the story. The two thirty-something individuals in the book talked in their heads like they were preparing for the prom and a sleepover. Ethan is supposed to be an innocent escort? Excuse me, there are none out there like this guy claims to be. Second, neither even had a likable personality. Nadine was not just a prude, she came off at times as snooty as her boss lady.

However, the story-line was often confusing because there were so many different characters and it was difficult to keep them all straight - who was double-crossing whom, who were the good guys and the bad guys (and the bad guys relationships with one another, as there was more than one group of bad guys)

My other issue with this book was the use of English spelling and conversation. I don't have a problem with English spelling and terminology; I know that kerb is the English spelling of curb, for example, and U.K. English uses whilst instead of while. But since this is a book that takes place in the U.S., and most of the characters are also from the U.S., and it seems to be written for a U.S. audience, I felt that, as an American reader, I was being constantly pulled out of the story to translate the words. The point of a good book is to keep the reader in the story, and this seemed like an unnecessary distraction. Perhaps offering a U.S. edition as well as a U.K. one would have been a good choice.

As other reviewers pointed out, there were a few typos. I didn't find too many, but enough to add yet another distraction to the book.

Finally, the end seemed a bit over-the-top and not really satisfying. Everyone was getting killed or shot, and the subplots didn't mesh together smoothly.

Joanna knew that with the trouble she was in even if it wasn't her doings the first person that she went to was to ask God to help her, kids now days wouldn't do that not if a adult would b but this young girl knew who to ask.
  It came first from a person that was right there able to help her out, but we know it was God that made it happen. She then thanked God for sending some one to help her.  Even at the end after talking more with the person that saved her, she was then able to do something mostly we would have never done and that was to forgive the one that had tried to steal her away and in her showing him that she forgave him, he found God also an hopefully he never was mean again.

I did like this story.  Raina was a good pov character and we did get a bechdel test pass...rare in romance and novellas. Tristan was a very typical controlling rich man with a tragic past (tm).

I really liked the use of summer theater as a way to move things along.  That was unique since it wasn't expected.

What I didn't like was the lack of the hero asking permission to kiss/have sex.

Technically, the novella could have used a good proofreader with an eye to commas and dependent clauses. It's enough that I noticed it.

The story ends on a happy for now ending, which is totally acceptable. There's enough here to satisfy readers who only want to read the one, but still encourages readers to buy the next novella.

The main male character, Tristian is just like Christian.  He's rich, sexy, charming, and controlling. He has hidden secrets that keep him closed off from emotions.  The main female, Raina is similar to Anna.  No confidence, inexperienced, and boring.

Raina completely falls for Tristan instantly.  Without knowing each other they start having sex and all of the sudden they seem in love and can't tell anyone about their relationship.  The story does have a few secrets regarding Raina's family and Tristan's past.

I rate this one a two out of five, even though I liked it, for a number of reasons. First, there are just too many grammar issues. Apostrophes missing or added incorrectly, awkward commas, the wrong words used (ex: tact vs tack). It really needs some editing. Second, this book and even Pathfinder spend way touch time in the character's head and on descriptions of things that don't matter. There is almost no dialog in these books and what dialog there is feels stilted. And no, I don't need a description of every hallway or guard we pass by. Third, the main characters are females who come off weak, indecisive, and only able to make stupid decisions. In contrast the males are aggressive, decisive, and ways know the right thing to do. It is beginning to make me question how the author views women. Personally, I like strong women with a good head on their shoulders. Points for not needing constant rescuing.

This was a fun read, but it the way it ended left me rather unsatisfied, so I truly hope you have a sequel planned.  I still have a lot of confusion with the world building and would have liked to have a better understanding of how Tate came to be in her situation by the end of the book. Thaat left me a little dissatisfied. However, Following Tate, her adventures, meeting her friends, finding out how she is ""dragon-ridden"", and the potential romantic interest (sequel?) was interesting and kept my attention.  I really enjoy stories where the female lead isn't afraid to take risks and take things into her own hands, and that fits this story.

The only negative (like with Pathfinder), is that the editing is awful.  Phrases like ""she fainted to the left""...where the word should be feinted, use of the word ""lesson"" instead of lessen, and many similar errors, plus weird punctuation errors, really do this story a disservice. Even for a $.99 book, I would expect that an effort at editing would be done, and the fact there were so many glaring errors was distracting and resulted in me dropping my rating of this story.

I like sci-fi that's easily readable, so no convoluted politics, a relatively small number of protagonists and some good action. The Frontiers Saga has all this and more. It's not a popcorn sci-fi series, but isn't grand space opera either. This series is enthralling, enjoyable and not overly heavy. There are plenty of moments of tension which kept me reading into the wee hours, but there are just as many moments of light-hearted banter interspersing the action to make this hugely readable. The characters are interesting, believable and develop well over the course of the series. I've enjoyed every moment so far and haven't had to skip any pages yet.

I waited months before beginning this series but since starting it just over month ago I've burned through half the series. You should really be prepared to spend $57 on the entire series which currently sits at 15 books. While that may sound a lot to spend do bear in mind you might only get two or three novels from other authors for the same cost.

He's a somewhat typical 13 year old, highly intelligent, a bit too outspoken for his own good, bored with school as the highly intelligent usually are, and generally disaffected by his life. Sound familiar? Whether you're someone who has already survived the teen years or dealing with them yourself, you will relate to Theo.

The suspense is well-sustained and keeps you turning the pages. The author has spun a great science fiction tale and created a vivid world. This story is a clean read with plenty of adventure and believable characters. While suitable for young readers, it's an enjoyable ""stress free"" read for adults as well. However, remember this story is designed and targeted for younger readers, for whom it's an excellent introduction to the world of sci-fi, but may not be what you're looking for if you're expecting a more sophisticated story/writing style populated with adult characters.

I appreciate the fact that the author stated that this book took years to write. I have to admit that I can truly relate to that, since mine did, too.

This series features much of Adams trademark humor and hijinx, along with a mountain of call backs to make for a great story,

Since this is a box set, the book is divided into two parts, the orginal 'Dirk Gentley's Holistic Detective Agency', and it's sequel, 'the Long Dark Tea Time of the soul'. The first features Richard MacDuff, a software engineer, on the run after a murder. Fortunately, Dirk Gentley is a college friend of his and agrees to help him out. For a fee of course. The book incorporates a ridiculous number of sci-fi moments, ridiculous characters, and funny jokes, all of which come back in the end to explain the central mystery. The whole novel is one of the best I've read from Adams.

The second book, however, was a bit of a let down. Like the first, the series starts with Dirk investigating a murder, but unlike the first, most of the books humor is Kafka comedy. Dirk is repeatedly assaulted and humiliated, to the point where it stops being funny. The story also wraps up far too quickly to be satisfying, with Deuteragonist Kate not even getting a proper sendoff. Essentially, it had all the same problems that made the last Hitchhikers book bad.

Adams is most famous for the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy [H2G2] series.  DGHDA shares the British absurdist humor of H2G2, but is a more genre-bending a work. While H2G2 crosses humor and sci-fi, DGHDA takes those two genres and throws detective and supernatural fiction into the works. The book was billed by the author as a detective-ghost-horror-who dunnit-time travel-romantic-musical-comedy-epic. Of these, horror is dubious given the fundamental silliness, epic is a little grandiose for a work of 300 pages, and the romantic and musical parts are rather thin.

The title refers to a detective agency owned by Dirk Gently, who believes in the fundamental interconnectedness of all things and is a bit of a con man. Gently is the lead character in a comedic sense, but his straight man--Richard MacDuff--has at least equal claim to being the books overall lead. (Just as straight man Arthur Dent leads in the H2G2 books.) Gently gets involve when he discovers Richard engaged in the inexplicable activity of breaking into the window of his (Richards) girlfriends apartmenta girlfriend with which he has a favorable relationship. This convinces Gently that Richard has either been hypnotized or possessed, either of which makes him a prime customer of Gentlys agency.

The mystery part of the novel revolves around the new owner and editor of a magazineGordon Way--who dies, and whose ghost continues to be active in story (even having PoV chapters in this shifting PoV novel.)  Richard comes to believe hes a suspect, although the bungling former editor of the magazineMichael Wenton-Weakes--is the lead suspect. Of course, the fact that the deceased is the father of Richards girlfriend, Susan Way, does encourage the notion that Richard could be involved. Of course, it wouldnt be much of a who-dun-it if it was a straightforward case of one of these men with motives having done it.

As would be expected of a book by Douglas Adams, it has its moments of hilarity, but it wasn't as funny as the best of the H2G2 books. The best absurdist device introduced into the book is the Electronic Monk. In an era in which no one has time for believing in things, one can purchase or rent a robot to believe things for oneparticularly those outlandish notions that are unsupported by evidence and thus are least worthy of the effort of belief.

The main characters are all sufficiently quirky to be memorable, likable, or both. The characters are one of the strengths of this book. The story is a bit disheveled, probably purposefully so, but it doesnt make for the easiest work to follow--particularly early in the story when one hasn't yet got a firm grasp of whos who and whos doing what. That said, its a decent enough plot, all things considered.

Id recommend this for those who like humorous speculative fiction.",The lesser known work of Douglas Adams,42,3/24/2016

1214,3,A2U7CRM1FZ0XIX,B00B2FOHOC,"This is an okay yoga book but it's lacking in several areas. I wouldn't call this a beginner yoga book at all, it is more an intermediate book. The poses are beginner, however the description and photos assumes that you will understand how to move into the next pose smoothly. Also, needing to flip pages to get to the next pose can be distracting or difficult with some poses. I understand this is an eBook and that's how it should be, but I would have liked to see an overview or summary at the end of each flow that puts the entire flow on one page for easy reference while doing the poses.

I did not like that the author suggests anyone can have a flat stomach. It's just not true or realistic. Yes, some people can have a flat stomach, but if you've been overweight for a lengthy amount of time you're going to have excess skin when you lose the weight, so you're not going to have that flat stomach she's promising. Additionally she compares her experience of pregnancy with bouncing right back into a flat stomach by working out. This is great if you started out in shape with a flat stomach prior to pregnancy, but if you weren't in shape and didn't have a flat stomach it's not going to be as easy as she makes it sound. She's only speaking to one audience in this book. People who are already in shape and/or have a general knowledge of yoga flows already. She makes promises that can't always be kept and I didn't appreciate her unrealistic approach. It turned me off from this book early on.

The photography for the poses is just okay. Often it is off centered which makes it odd to look at. There is a photo of each pose in it's final state, however there are no photos showing how to move into that pose, only text description which I felt was lacking.

There are no modifications listed in this book. If you have any joint issues or lack flexibility or balance you will not know what you can do to modify these poses to work for you. Again, this book is not for the beginner.

Overall this is an okay book as long as you go into knowing the reality of the flat belly. Did you have one before? Do you have a lot of weight to lose that may result in excess fat? Are you already in shape or are you starting from being sedentary? This book is recommended for people who already understand yoga flows, do not need modifications, and who have no issues with joints, flexibility or balance.

1219,5,AJDD13W7UQ6LN,B00B3GGYAU,"This is an eye-opening book on the topic of the KKK. If you haven't really read much about the Klan before, this would be a great go-to volume.

KLAN: Killing America is a collection of newspaper articles from the many years that the Ku Klux Klan was active running (which may be a lot longer than most people suspect!). From these articles, the reader can take away the general feeling that the people felt about the KKK during its peak, plus some of the important events that altered American history forever. You'll be sure to discover facts you didn't know before.

What really touched home for me? I found several newspaper articles published from my own hometown (or elsewhere in the state), and I had never before realized Oklahoma was so greatly affected by the Ku Klux Klan and their vicious acts. It came to a shock to me, but am glad I learned more about my state's history by reading this volume. Of course, so many states were affected by the Klan, and it's ALL covered in this book.

The KKK went after a wide variety of people -- specifically people that they thought were poisonous to society. There are lists in this book which break down the reasons why the KKK killed citizens, which sometimes includes some odd ones, like ""highway robbery"", ""voodooism"", ""unpopularity"", ""eloping"" (hah!!!), or even for an ""unknown cause"". It can get pretty weird knowing the reason behind why the KKK wanted to kill these people. Something else that caught my attention is this one article in this book that comes from The Southern Indicator in 1921, entitled ""Negro Pastor Endorses Klan""... what?! Definitely, there's some crazy stuff in here you'd never expect to see.

It is then followed by an excerpt from The Kept Woman advertised to be on sale 20 September 2016. The prolog to that excerpt should guarantee sales. This is one of those times when it is good to take Amazons offer of a free sample. But back to the short story Cold, Cold Heart.

Jon (previously John, before the later than mid-life crisis) and Pam had been together and married for a long time. Both were high school teachers; they had little money and had to live on a tightly controlled budget. And Jon controlled the budget very strictly even refusing to give Pam lunch money when she had run out early in the week. He did give her advice; she was to budget more wisely.

Jon believed he had superior intellect even though Pam was the one with a doctorate in biology. Jon held no advanced degree. For any problem that popped up, Jon shrugged his shoulders and replied that they should just let things work themselves out. That did not work out so well with their son Zachary. Pam informed Jon about the drugs, the alcohol, the exuberant sex life of their teenage son but Jon just shrugged it off. But Jon could not shrug off Zacharys death in a car accident. Jon could not get over ignoring Pams earlier concerns when it was found that Zacharys blood alcohol content was six times over the legal limit. Jon blamed the failure of their sex life after the death of their son on depression.

But Pam already knew about some of Jons infidelities. She put up with some but could not ignore the one in which he ran away with a younger woman, went to California, and married her. Jon had spent a lot of time prior to his divorce from Pam writing a book. It was hugely successful; Jon became rich. He tried to give some money to Pam but the betrayed wife accepted none of it. And now Jon had phoned her to invite her to visit him in California and witness his death.

Jon had accepted death but wanted to be decapitated and have his head and body cryogenically preserved for a later return. He also wanted to see Pam one last time, not to apologize for anything but to confess. Jon had kept journals for all of the time he had been married to Pam. He wanted her to read them. In each journal, he named the women he had a relationship with during his marriage to Pam. There were a lot of journals. Rather than making amends to Pam, he wanted to gloat, to stick the knife in once again, with a shrug of the shoulders and a smirk.

And now it is Pams turn. Her reaction and behavior in response to Jons confession makes the story worth reading.

The characters in this short story are well developed. I felt sorry for the wasted life that was Pams. I loathed the superior attitude of Jon (John). Zachary was not around long enough to engender feelings but he was only important as a writing prompt. The story action is mostly in Pams mind as she looks back and reflects on her married life: what she knew, what she didn't know, the unequal and unfair life she had with Jon. As her reflections alternate between her feelings about herself, her son Zach, and her changing feelings for Jon, the story moves quickly.

They couldn't get past the tragedy, so after twenty years of marriage, she was on her own.

I wonder, is she out for revenge?

I love that she is her own person, doing the things she had denied herself to stay in shape. Dont we all do that, wanting to look different, wanting our older bodies to look like its twenty?

She is strong, stronger than John, her ex.

And John, I really don't like him. Hes a jerk and makes it easy not to like him! The more I read about him, the more p***ed off I get! When you read about him, I think you will agree.

As morbid as the book gets, I cant help but laugh at Pams thoughts, at times. To me that speaks to Karin Slaughters ability to write a great story.

John had been dead for almost two years. They had been married for many years and had met at a young adult Sunday school class some twenty-four years earlier. They dated, became lovers, married, taught high school chemistry and biology, and had a beautiful son Zachary. Everything was perfect at first.

Pam was now alone at age fifty-two, and for the first time in her life she did not care about her appearance. Her marriage had not been good. She recalled when he was dying and asked her to come.

Zachary was gone, too. At age sixteen. He died too young. She had warned her husband about their sons drinking. Would her son be alive today if she had stood up to her husband?

John had said he wanted to be put into stasis. He wanted to be cryogenically frozen, so he could be reanimated one day. Who wants more of the sucker?  His book Biological Healing had been on the bestseller list. He wrote about his son and his ex-wife. Nine years earlier, she had caught him cheating with one of the other secretaries. He was mean, and hateful, and never mentioned the real truth in his stupid book. He had been with some woman the day before their son died, she discovered when reading his journals. The smirk on his face, when he was dying and the other wife, half his age.

However, now with his body, is her chance to get REVENGE once and for all! She will make sure he knows.

In most countries their limited to 250 watts of power and a speed of nor greater than 16 mph. (The motor cannot assist after the bicycle reaches 16 mph.) If only riding around in a flat area, and weight 140 lbs or so, that's probably fine. No so good in San Francisco or the mountains and you weight 250 lbs. China is the larges market, adding 20 million electric bikes/year. Electric bikes in the U.S. have up to 750 watts power; their average price is over $3,000, vs. $600 in China.

There are two main types of electric bike propulsion systems. The first type is a hub motor, the second is a motorized bottom bracket and work through the rear wheel gears. A hub motor is simple and easy to retrofit a bike with. However, since the motor drives the wheel directly, the gears cannot help when climbing hills. Another disadvantage is that the hub motor is 'unsprung' weight and may make handling more difficult. A disadvantage of a mid-drive system is that they require the bicycle frame to be designed to hold it.

Check potential electric bike purchases for battery ratings - a higher 'cycle' (the number of times it can be recharged) rating is better. A warranty is also important - some Chinese batteries don't last nearly as long as stated. A standard measure of battery endurance is also valuable - make certain it refers to an environment with NO pedaling.

A 250-watt hour battery will run a 750-watt motor for 15-20 minutes - that will not get you 30 miles on a charge, as some advertise.","Very Basic, but Still Helpful",4,7/31/2016

Although the main characters are pretty contrived, that didn't bother me. It's clear from the outset to the reader (if not the characters themselves) that these are truly *special* young people with a DESTINY. The story is very fantastic, moving between a relatable real-life and a fantasy dream world of magic and unknown powers.

That said, I simply found the writing to be the opposite of compelling. The language used, overall, and the storytelling simply doesn't live up to most of what is available for children in the young adult category. I've spent a LOT of time over the past ten years reading books that target this genre, and this one doesn't measure up.

For a while, I took a different perspective - perhaps the book is written for younger people, tweens, upper elementary. In that case, while I still find a lack of compelling story telling, at least the simplicity of language used makes a bit more sense. However, in this case, I take issue with some language used by the characters. Multiple times through the book, these heroic, but JUVENILE main character use the phrase ""What the hell..."". As a parent and as an educator, I can't embrace that casual use of adult language in this book. It's not appropriate for elementary reading, so that rules out my thinking that the book might be directed towards this age group.

I originally sought out this book because the synopsis led me to believe that components of the story would appeal to my science fiction and fantasy loving children; however, having read the book, I do not believe my middle schooler nor my high schooler would have any interest, and I think there are much better reads for my elementary schooler.

Again, to emphasize: this is not a horrible book. But it's not better than ""just okay."" It simply doesn't have that much to offer.

1243,5,AM1XDIUYI64JB,B00BB7P1NW,"Whatever flaws we might identify or frustrations we might feel are trivial in comparison to a reader's pure joy in losing himself/herself in a narrative. When all the elements come together: an intriguing plot, thoughtful, profound themes, complex, troubling, characters, and language that make us shudder for its honesty, clarity, and confidence; we gratefully set all analysis aside and give ourselves up to the sheer magic of a great book. And for me, The Five Shields: The Lost Souls, is such a book.

Author Ilan Dvir  weaves a fantastic sci-fi fantasy tale, with intriguing twists and turns that will easily captivate the reader's attention from the beginning. The story had every element a good story should have. An exciting plot, attention to detail, but best of all fleshed out, well-written and well-rounded character development. Theres an abundance of well illustrated scenes that make you feel like you are right there in the story, and that's something I really look for in a good book.

The book description says it all; 'A sharp knock in the middle of the night awakens Henri and Aline. They discover on their doorstep a swaddled baby with only a mysterious ring wrapped in her blankets. They decide to keep their find a secret and tell the world she is theirs, not knowing that every secret comes at a price. They name her Rose.

On their thirteenth birthdays, Rose and four other teenagers from across the globe discover that they are The Five Shields, tasked with protecting the worlds fate and the balance of good and evil. All they have in common is a mysterious, powerful gem. On a life-changing journey, they discover untold powers hidden within them.

The Five Shields must fight to free the lost souls before it is too late. But first they must defeat sinister, dark forces hell-bent on their total destruction. If the Shields succeed, light will triumph; if they fail, darkness will reign. Who will prevail?'

Now, if thats not enough to whet your appetite, I don't know what will. But if you want to find out what happens youll just have to turn the pages for yourself to find out! But I will say it's well worth the read. It's my first time reading this author and I must say I was very impressed.

This captivating and commendable work had me immersed from the beginning. The story flowed from scene to scene with ease, and the author shows exceptional ability when it comes to storytelling. There are plenty of attention-grabbing moments in this page turner that will take the reader on a spellbinding journey!

Its one of those books that come along once in awhile that makes you want to read it non-stop until you get to the end. Im giving nothing further away here. And this, I hope, will only add to the mystery and enjoyment for the reader. I will say, however, that the younger reader of the sci-fi fantasy genre will love having a nibble on this one!

If this book is anything to go by, Ill certainly be looking forward to reading more from Ilan Dvir in the future. I would definitely recommend this book and would love to see it adapted for the Silver Screen. Five stars from me.",Author Ilan Dvir  weaves a fantastic sci-fi fantasy tale,7,9/28/2017
1244,5,AO8A1C81YSXWX,B00BBTW0MU,"I was first impressed with this book because it starts out with a great pep talk, but also includes acceptance that not all things work for all people and let go of the things that didn't work for you.  I really appreciate this since I've read other books that basically say, ""You didn't lose weight with exercise?  You weren't trying hard enough."" and things that are basically insulting.  This wasn't like that at all.  Very positive.

The ebook contains links to other resources and calculators.  I love that it also includes the formula so I'm not just putting in numbers and getting a result, but can see why this is the result and how to effect it.  In the section about exercises, there are also links to videos showing how to properly do them.

My only criticism of this book is that the actual ""plan"" is very vague.  It says that is intentional because no 2 people lose weight the same way.  As I indicated earlier, I appreciate that, but when I got to the end of the book all excited with this information and it was basically ""make a plan and stick to it"" I was a little bit disappointed.  I was looking for the ""do these steps and you'll lose the 10lbs in a week!""  but their points are more realistic so I didn't knock down a star in the review, but just a bit of a bummer that now I have to use the information and think about how I will create a plan for myself.  It does have a sample plan, so it's not like there's nothing.  The rest of the chapters were just so detailed that I was hoping this would be, too.  Makes more sense that it's not though.  The great information in this book gives me the power to make the right decisions for my body.

1246,2,A3EPYI2DA9U409,B00BC6SSKU,"Misty Bauer has moved from Arizona and away from her ex-husband. She plans to start fresh in this new town but her family throw things into chaos and after a car accident she ends up seeing Aaron Price the fireman who rescued her.

I did like this however to describe Aaron and Misty's relationship as hasty would be an understatement. They had a connection and the story was hot but again, just like in a lot of other books I've read recently,  it all went far too quickly for my taste. For this reason I didn't fully connect with Aaron because everything happened too fast to get to know him and I couldn't even properly picture him by the end.

Cautious should have actually been called incautious.
Misty was adamant she wanted to take it slow yet within 24 hours of meeting him they were having sex. If she had been looking for a sex and wanted to get into a relationship it would have been something different and made sense but it made her decisions have less conviction. Later on in the book she also had a conversation with her sister that I know would have gone differently if it had been me and my sister. Maybe it makes me a lesser person than this fictional character but I accept that as there is no way in hell I would have accepted the situation with her sibling, especially that quickly. There just wasn't enough time for her to go through all the stages to come out to that resolution. This needed to be longer, have less sex and more depth for it to work.

For this reason I give Cautious 5 out of 10 but it does get
2 flames for heat.

And, Amazon has the whole review showing on the book page so I couldn't miss the OMG at the end of the review. However I love Sienna and felt I needed to keep reading. I knew Siena was going to have to go through some rough times, but in this book it really hurt. I just hope she is able to get through this and still be herself after.

Judging by the ratings, I thought the author might pull out a meaningful story and bought the sequel. So Sorry I did. After ten years, the characters hadn't evolved at all. The first time Sebastion gets drunk he embarrasses the whole marine core, begging and crying like a baby. They both disgusted me. There were so missed opportunities for the characters to grow with both in key places right after 9/11. I know Sebastion saw more than hr in the Middle East but it's not mentioned. I should be even more screwed up. And as usual, the two barely touched on the people they left behind. Except for Brenda. WHY Brenda of all people and why is he still friends with her??? I wanted to know about her divorce and his parents. All these people left a mess behind and I wanted to know more about what happened in the aftermath. Instead, we get bits and more the constant juvenile bickering between the two, his insecurity and her aloofness and an overload of sex.

1253,5,ATZOHBDX5VNKJ,B00BD63EIK,"Eva & Jack Ryker met as young college students, fell in love, became business partners and parents. They worked long hours building their successful business and love flourished. Jack & Eva included family in their business and thought of ways to include their employees as the business grew and success followed. Providing employees with stock options, retirement plans, bonuses and more insured loyalty and low turnover. As Eva & Jack approached time when they could easily retire and spend years enjoying the good life as billionaires, Eva was killed in a tragic accident. Jack lost his best friend, love of his life and business partner in one moment and it destroyed him! He fell into a deep depression, excused himself from social events, self-care became a part of his past and long hours poured into working became his norm. It was no way to live, but he couldn't find the zest for life and his adult children worried.

As Jack was preparing for another grueling day at the office, watching the morning news (rather than focusing on presenting his best self) a story about a new way young ladies were paying for college came on. The news story focused on a website where Sugar Daddies (rich older men) connected with beautiful young college women, Sugar Babies, and began arrangements or relationships. The men chose the girl(s) from website profiles and could send a message to meet. The type of arrangement was up to the couple, but sex was usually involved. Jack took a look at the site and found Kate. Actually, she used an alias, but revealed her real name at a later date.

This story is about the relationship between Jack & Kate. She brought him happiness, zest for life, sex like he was 20 instead of 49 and drew him completely out of his depression. Jack gave Kate her first orgasm  and made her fashion dreams come true. Just as Eva & Jack started a business, he gave the same to Kate. He helped build-up her self-confidence, enriched her life with beautiful clothing and exotic travel plus many orgasmic opportunities. The only thing that was an issue, their 27-year age difference. She was just starting life and he was retiring. His mind on getting out of New York, grandchildren and seeing the success of his son & daughter.

The story is beautiful fiction. There are lots of errors that a good editor could have fixed, but I still give it five stars. The end of the story isn't a cliffhanger, but definitely is left wide open for the sequel. Some might say it's a happy ending based on Jack's intentions and what's probably best overall. However, there is plenty of room for change and I believe a reuniting will occur in the next book based on the title alone. I will read it and hope to learn more about Jack's kids too.

The conjugation is lie-lay or lay-laid. People ""lie"" down but ""lay"" down in the past. Holy cow. And please, please, please ""all right"" is ALWAYS two words! The constant moving back and forth between first person narratives within the same chapter is dizzying. Either write in the third person, or at least flesh out a chapter for each person's narrative.

1256,3,A2QQ3NQ70O25EE,B00BD75QQW,"It is extremely difficult for an author to carve a niche in a genre so overdone. But this faltered. The plots were centered around the out of control lust of the good guys and the bad guys. This is the second time that homosexuality played a huge part in the storyline. Some may find this interesting but I found it too much. But the aspect which really made me uncomfortable but which the story depended upon was the raging lust experienced by our two main characters for the same woman juxtaposed against raging lust by the homosexuals for the same man-making them the same. Very modern viewpoint. Very PC.  Not why I read Victorian mysteries. But, Ms Smart is finding her own uniques voice. It is a turnoff for me but she knew that would happen when she wrote it.

This second mystery, however, was problematic in two ways. The incessant listing of the doctor after any woman who walks near him became ridiculous. And it may be just a plot twist to have the murderers in the first book be lesbian but when the second's victim is gay and involved in a scandalous group of gay men, that smacks of homophobia.

Scarlett Ross trusted the wrong man to love and to fund her restaurant... He turned out to have ties to the mob. When an ambitious prosecutor wanted her to testify against her boyfriend, her name and life was ruined. When two toughs almost cut her throat, she grabbed everything she could and ran... to one place she only heard of two weeks ago... A little town called Sweetgrass Springs in Texas, where her mother came from, but never mentioned. Scarlett was all alone in the world after her mother's death, and only in browsing through her mother's diary did she find that she does have a grandma in Texas. On the way, she was stranded by a flat tire and was rescued by sexy cowboy Ian McLaren, who also lived in town. As Scarlett found her grandma Ruby, her hesitation grew... How will she fit in in the quiet lifestyle and the close-knit community? How could she tell her grandma, whom she had never seen, that momma is gone? How could he tell Ian that she's interested but not ready? How could she explain that dangerous men are after her and she could never put anyone in town in danger? And as she grew more attached to the town, that she must leave before she hurt any more people?

The ""going home"" stories are evergreen in in romance, but going back to a ""home"" you never knew you had? That's definitely a new spin on things. The FMC was also heavily encouraged to stay, partly to help grandma, partly so she can be with the MMC. The threat was neutralized later, while not primary of her doing, was handle much more adeptly than a different romance with a very similar premise which I will not mention by name.

Scarlett's mother had died, and the only family Scarlet had, that she knew of, until going through her mother's things, found she had a Grandmother in Sweetgrass Springs, After Scarlet was threatened during the night, while sleeping, with a knife at her throat, by mafia thugs warning her not to testify, she packed what she could, and with a box of momentos of her mother, she headed to Sweetgrass Springs, in Texas. Scarlet was hoping to find her Grandmother, and find safety in distance until needed to testify.

How the author unfolds the story of Scarlet and Sweetgrass Spring is very pleasant, that I wished I was part of the town and had a home in such a beautiful area.

1283,3,A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,B00BF2APBQ,"As this story starts off, there is a small Texas town that is slowly dying.  The residents are all slowly losing their land, they are all broke with no prospects of getting any funds.  There is drought and no rain in sight.  There is the widow with 2 small children and a teen boy, her husband was recently killed in a tractor accident.  The woman that is almost single handedly keeping the town afloat is 70+ years old and getting tired.  The mortgage is coming due on  her latest purchase, the old courthouse, and she has no prospects of getting enough money to keep the bank from foreclosing.  Her granddaughter, that she didn't know she had, shows up in town having run from New York where she was implicated in a drug scandal.  I think that is all the depressing stuff.  Oh yes, the heroes father suffered a stroke and they are about to lose their ranch because he will not allow the hero to make the ranch profitable.  Oh yes, there is also the deputy sheriff that is the town bully and seems to be getting away with his bad behavior.

Now, on the plus side, there is a hot sexy cowboy!!  That is about all that was on the plus side.  The heroine spends the whole story talking about leaving the small town so that she doesn't bring the mafia and it's trouble into the small town looking for her.  Of course she and the cowboy hook up but she won't tell him what her problem is.  He has a lot of issues himself but he still falls for her.  And she continues to say she is leaving town in just a few short days.  Overt and over she goes over this same sentiment.  I got so tired of hearing it.

I really got tired of hearing all the sad tales.  There never seemed to be a bright moment in an of this.  Then the mafia does show up in the town and so now we are dealing with a crooked DA. in New York and more negative stuff.  I just quit reading.  I really like to read a good love story and then feel good when it is over.  This one just was too depressing to me.  I'm sure the heroine is going to save the day and the town, etc. but I just don't want to spend any more time with her.  So, I quit reading.  There is really nothing wrong with the story, it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I suppose it could be described as a story of struggle, forgiveness, discovery, etc.  And I think it would appeal to a lot of readers.  It just didn't work for me.

I enjoyed his character as a detective with Aspergers. It was different and showed imagination.  But,  didn't enjoy The Harbinger series at all. These books read like a 10 year old wrote them in a school Writing class. The main character, Kent, is so poorly written he becomes someone to hate after the first sentences out of his mouth.
I couldn't get past the short story.  I spot read ahead to search for some improvement in writing skills - there wasn't any.  There were two things that stuck in my mind.  If these characters approached you on the street, all you would see was the clothes they were wearing.  They had no substance. The story line was like swiss cheese with more holes than cheese.
There are great authors out there that know how to write smart ass, sarcastic, off-the-wall, and odd ball characters. Characters like Virgil Flowers, Lucas Davenport, Cody Hoyt, Harry Bosche and Agent Pendergast.

It wasn't until the very final book in this collection that I even saw him as remotely human. At first, I enjoyed his brashness, but it wore me down (as it did several of the books characters) to the point that I honestly didn't care if he lived or died.
Whoever edited the book missed a lot of misteaks (misspelling here is intended). Poor grammar and spelling, missing words, etc. That detracted from the read and made the collection feel like everybody was in a rush to meet a publishing deadline. I was also distracted by the short, choppy sentence fragments. Doesnt the author or editor know what a semicolon is and how its used?

I figure if you're going to read about serial killers, you ought to be ready for some horrendous stuff, so that I was prepared for.  What really bothered me was the fact that one of the investigators was just as twisted as the killers he sought, which explained why he was so good at tracking them down.  Okay, I can even live with that.  But when the investigator constantly demeans and embarrasses one of the female investigators in very extreme ways, does it in front of the entire (otherwise all-male) squad at the police station, and not one of them stops him AND the female goes running after him like a love-sick puppy.... that's when it gets bad.

I hate doing these type of reviews. I want to read a book and be able to rate it on the story and character development, not get bogged down talking about the mechanics and editing.
But for a book like this, it has to be done because the book is, in fact, nearly unreadable in its current state. Why? For starters, there isn't a single quotation mark in the book. So when someone talks, theres nothing to seperate it from the surrounding text. Im hoping its just a bad port to ebook, and that it wasn't some affectation of the author's.
Another thing I noticed is everyone ""says"". They don't retort, mutter, sigh, yell, howl, shriek, whisper or do any of the other plethora of sounds humans make when speaking. They don't even ""say angrily"" They just ""say"". What are they, robots?
The descriptive text isn't good across the board. The whole book reads like the author  had a decent idea for the story, but absolutely no concept of writing mechanics whatsoever and no editor or experienced writer to help out.

 Self published ebooks are great because it broke the stranglehold the big publishers had on the industry, allowing great unknown authors who would never be published under the old way a chance to get their books out there.
Unfortunately, the downside is anyone with an idea can write an ebook, whether or not they actually have any mechanical skill at writing or know the value of a good editor. The Settlers is unfortunately one of the latter in my eyes. I will not be finishing this book.","No quotation marks, very amateur writing",3,5/26/2016

It's a nasty surprise to discover a class system of elites and slaves. Most people, of course, are the slaves. At first, they are too grateful for a place on the lifeboats to care. But then, a champion arises, a beautiful young woman speaking of peaceful change to equality. A woman who was born on Earth, underwent a controversial treatment to extend life, which had killed all the other participants. Saved by a brilliant and unique friend, they work toward a better live for humanity. But not everyone is ready.

1298,5,A28X02I7Q5J48B,B00BGL42JC,"I received this book about a diet and nutrition plan for strength training. There are many viewpoints on diet and nutrition plans for strength training so I was very interested to read this book and see the thoughts of the author. First you need to fuel your body with water, and foods that have lots of carbohydrates and protein which will fuel your workouts. This could be smoothies, cheese and crackers, or granola bars among other things. After a workout it is also important to fuel your muscles, so drinking plenty of water and eating more foods with lots of carbs and protein will help your muscles recover and rebuild energy. This guy asserts that carbohydrates will help with your strength training as much or more as high protein diets. I am happy to hear someone talking about how necessary carbohydrates are because so many people are into low-carb diets now. He also talks about why you need protein, and the different ways to include protein in your diet, such as food, and protein shakes. He gives tons of food recommendations when trying to add in protein to your diet, such as beef, eggs, tofu, quinoa, chicken, legumes, and fish. He speaks of the importance of carbs and fat in your diet since these both play a major role. He also talks about how to determine your daily calorie goal. He suggests multiplying your body weight by 20 to find your calorie goal for the day. Personally, that would put me at 2220 calories per day which is less than I eat right now for trying to gain weight. He points out that you should not restrict yourself from foods, you should avoid fad diets, and set realistic goals for yourself. He talks about supplements that you should consider taking, such as fish oil, multi vitamins, creatine, and protein. I highly agree with these and agree there aren't many more supplements you actually need. He even gives a sample diet and nutrition plan in the book and tons of yummy recipes! I was actually very impressed with this book because I feel that the author knows what he is talking about. So many people encourage fad diets or restrictions, and you just cant get stronger from those types of things. I encourage people to read this book. I think it is a great resource.

( so many diets scare people from eating carbs)  and Fat and gives scientific facts of why your body needs the commonly feared food items to function correctly and build muscles.

I have read all John Heldts Northwest Passage Time Travel stories.  Rather than provide a synopsis on each and every one, Im instead going to simply state my assessment of these novels as a whole and include it as a review on each one of the of the series.

Every story is about traveling into the past and setting the stage for the future.  If you like time-travel, youll love this series.  If I had to pick my favorite, for now I think The Journey would be it, but thats just me.

Every story is a stand-alone novel.  Occasionally there will be a subtle reference to one of the other novels, but that too is sufficiently explained to make it germane to the current story without requiring one to read any of the other stories.

Because every story is stand-alone, they don't have to be read in any order.  However, reading them in the sequence of being written will enable the reader to make most of the connections no matter how subtle they are.  (The Journey is the only one that doesnt appear tie in to the others  unless I missed something.)

What impresses me the most is how the author managed to tell five different stories, yet have them tie together in so many subtle ways.  How was he able to keep track of everything?  And, bless his heart, he doesnt introduce too many characters to keep track of (I hate getting most of the way through a novel only to wonder whos Fred? when he shows up long after being forgotten by myself).

The only negative? comment I might make is that the protagonists exercise wisdom way beyond their age when dealing with others.  And, thats not really a negative, but a wish that I might have shown such wisdom at that age instead of acquiring it the hard way.",Northwest Passage Series,4,2/9/2016
1307,4,A1KPHT4N4GP6AF,B00BGY7XX6,"1st up - read the books in order as they truly are part of a series and truly aren't standalone.

2nd - the series is just plain FUN for a teenaged girl, but there is some serious violence (including death) so this doesn't qualify for a PG13 rating, in my opinion.

3rd - The main heroine is what every normal teen girl wants to be - beautiful, skilled and gifted in almost every way she could imagine.  The main heroine grows in a variety of ways from an ""ugly duckling into a beautiful swan"" - another aspect of fantasy hope for a teen.

4th - Yes, the author is an immature writer and it shows with poor sentence syntax, grammatical errors up the wazoo (wrong words, missing words, added words, etc.), plus long dialogue where you've no idea who is speaking until the very end ... and so forth.

It all makes for an extremely challenging reading environment and there-in lies one of the major drawbacks of the series.

5th - there are truly some laugh out loud moments. The author has a good sense of humour and allows it to play out through many of the characters in the storyline.

6th - I'm a gramma of a mid-teenaged granddaughter and while I wouldn't want her sleeping with a boyfriend for any reason at her age, I can fully respect that the love interests in this series are ONLY just sleeping together and not having sex until marriage (as far as we know, anyway).

The story is told in the first person, present tense, so if Ryanne, the main character, doesn't think or talk about it, the reader doesn't know anything about it. Maryanne is an almost eighteen year old high school senior. Her mother died over a year ago and Ryanne, and everyone around her, acts like it happened a month ago. At least, Ryanne acts like her life is over and everyone appears to continue to let her think this way. In addition, her critical high school English assignment is to read ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"" a book most children read in elementary or middle school. This is how the novel starts, so it is unbelievable from the get-go. Then various odd things happen. She has weird feelings for no reason. The weather is very odd. She nearly gets hit by a car and a guest of wind carries her away from harm. Various young women have disappeared. She suddenly appears in another world, runs like a track star, fights fantastical beasts, and pops home. While Ryanne may freak out when the more surprising of these events occur, she doesn't really think twice about them afterwards. When she meets a really cute guy who helps her after the gust of wind event and is told that he goes to school with her, she is surprised, because she has never seen him before and the school is not very big. Yet when he then shows up constantly at school thereafter, she doesn't think twice. None of her thoughts or reactions ring true to life. Worse, they are not remotely interesting. Then there is the abysmal writing. Truly, it reads like a very bad high school freshman creative writing project. Again, the first person present tense voice makes every sentence feel a bit like ""See spot run."" It does not help that subject matter is so boring and/or irritating. For example, paraphrasing, there is a sequence where Ryanne states ""The town is small. Getting to the bookstore is quick. The town is small. Finding parking is difficult. (?!) I park across the street from the bookstore."" Really. I read this book for as long as I could stand hoping, vainly, that the writing or the story would improve. When the pace remained as plodding and Ryanne remained as psychotically unemotional as ever even after being told about magic, I gave up. I cannot understand how this book got such great reviews.

It was written toward the end of the 19th century, so expect that style of writing. A background in Latin would be helpful. However since that is not a core topic taught in most public schools, the reader may need to frequently use the built-in e-dictionary.  Even so, many words, names or places are not found.  The author makes assumptions about a reader's knowledge regarding the shifting borders and names over the last two thousand years.  It would be great to have a large map on the wall with lots of overlays to refer to while reading this. Buried in an e-book, the maps are not terrifically helpful. It would also be useful to have a timeline with a series of overlays showing the key players in the overlapping regions of activity.

The problem is, she's a decent human being in an inhuman setting. You see, the 'refugees' in Cottonwood aren't just refugeesthey're aliens. They were rounded up and put into camps 'for their own protection.' Her very decency creates conflict for her and has consequences beyond her imagination.

  However, disappointing. The ""gifts"" idea and Rebecca infiltrating through marriage were what interested me in reading to begin with. But the ""gifts"" themselves don't add much interest, unless you like detailed fight descriptions.  There is very little explanation of how the gifting takes place - we only know there is genetic modification, a serum, and a procedure, during which almost half of the recipients die on the operating table. Also little about what the gifting changes in a person. How can a human body develop the ability to run 60-70 miles an hour? Can this really happen with stronger muscles, better wind, faster rhythm, and training?  I think this book falls a bit too far short in the scientific realms for me. And I'm not even considering how realistic the post-nuclear-war world is or isn't.
  Early on we are told the resistance doesn't want to make a ""martyr"" out of Eric Dane, they know they need to expose him. But I see no focus on exposing him or what he is doing, and then a lot of focus on killing him. But I guess that is after Rebecca becomes the leader.
  I ended up not liking Rebecca, and not seeing how she could be accepted as the leader. Despite going through extreme physical training (which surely must require great self-discipline), and the discipline she must have in living as a spy, Rebecca at other times shows no control over her emotional reactions. A leader should think before acting.
  I did read the whole book, and the last chapter did give me the desire to read the next book, to find out what happens with that character. But this first book was free, and I will not pay to read the next. If it was available free today, I might read it.",Okay but disappointing.,4,1/8/2017

Okay, so you've got a triangle - no, a square of love going on. Mix this in with dictatorship, the removal of free-will, nuclear fallout, and genetic enhancements (as well as genetic de-evolution).  The US isn't as united, but now consists of a wall around the Midwest.  Technology and relative comforts are available. Outside the wall - the wasteland....and rebels.

The Legacy is a trilogy launch and leaves a significant cliff-hanger.  That said, I did find the read pretty predictable.  It flows well and there is action, as well as character development.  In all - an entertaining read.",Entertaining Trilogy Launch,6,1/7/2017
1352,2,AJVVTOO9FT2N3,B00BPSC770,"This is a story about life in the United States (or New United States) after a nuclear war. It is technically a well-written book, but it makes nuclear war seem a little too ""clean"". After only ten years, the New US is up and running even better than it was before. That is that highly unlikely. Even if an area wasn't hit by the bombs, the fallout or nuclear winter would impact everywhere. It is said a few times that technology is better than it was before, but there are no demonstrations of that and it is also highly unlikely, as most technology would be destroyed by the EMP from a nuclear bomb.

The New US comprises ten states that used to be called the ""breadbasket"" of the US, but supposedly, ""man cannot live on bread alone"". The characters are always drinking coffee. Where do they get it? The US imports its coffee, and it is stated in the book that the New US has no contact with the outside world. What about fruit from Florida and California and imports from other parts of the US? It is also stated that a fence is built along the borders of the ten New US states to keep out mutants and cannibals and other riff raff. Really? How and with what raw materials? And labor? Only 15 million people survived the war in the US. The US used to feed the world. Where is all that food going?

People seem to eat great food, go to restaurants, go shopping, watch TV, and play Xbox, only, of course, in the New US. They wear nice clothes, the women have makeup and toiletries, and they have cell phones. Once again, where do the cell phones come from? The US has little manufacturing capacity now. Are we supposed to believe it was all rebuilt in ten years after a nuclear war? And all this is attributed to one man, who is brilliant and handsome and a tyrant. He is described as a tyrant almost from the minute he is introduced. Yeah, he does some tyrant-like stuff, but the people in the New US are well-fed, clean, have jobs, and new cell phones. How bad can he be?

The main character is Rebecca. Of course, she is beautiful and as soon as the ""tyrant"" sees her, he falls in love with her and marries her. She's a spy for the resistance, but I guess intelligence capabilities are the one thing not as good as they once were. She is a strong female character, but is also shown to be vulnerable, so she's a pretty well-rounded character. Her spying, however, is amateurish, and I don't know why it took her husband so long to find out, especially if he's this evil genius.

Rebecca's father tells her how people outside the fence are suffering, but when she leaves the New US, she goes to some of the outposts and is jealous to see whole families together, sitting around the fire, eating, and seeming to be happy. I guess some of them don't have electricity or hot water, but some of them do. They are not suffering equally, I guess.

This is an unrealistic book. The story could have been good, if not set against the ""opulence"" of post-nuclear war America. It's a fairly long book, too, and I found myself wondering why I was still reading it.

Near the end of the book, a completely new character is mentioned, which is a total cheat to the readers and is the only reason for a sequel because the story is pretty much closed by the end of this book.

It is his Eurasian coloring that is one of the main focuses of this book and one of his biggest challenges, and yet to look at him on this cover, there is no evidence of it. I would very much like to have seen this racial blending of his features.

This is a clean romance and a really interesting read. The Calcutta setting is refreshing. The author gives us a hero who grapples  with his mixed race in a way that is vulnerable and realistic.  The heroine, too, encounters her own personal difficulties as a woman who wants to be more than just a prize with a generous dowry.

The way in which the author handles the theme of revenge provides some  interesting twists. For the most part, I enjoyed this couple very much.

Reviewed by Author Roy Murry

I started reading Book 1 & 2 of this series and couldn't stop. I continued on and read book three - Island of Illusions. Ms. Jennings style is smooth. She effortlessly tells a story of an interesting mystery.

Her lead character Sarah Woods, a masseuse and housewife, is at a crucial turning point in her life. Then in a flash she is involved with a murder in book one. From there on, she stumbles into situations that the need her unique intuition.

The individual plots of each book are well constructed leading the reader to an unpredictable end. In each, I was involved to the end, leaving with me with the thought  why didn't I think of that? And, I have read many mysteries.

The main characters are evolving nicely; and I look forward to reading more.",Review Sarah Woods,3,6/15/2016
1370,3,A3IVX0OB04UN3H,B00BR3AT9G,"While the book was well written--very descriptive, clean grammar and spelling, interesting characters--I just couldn't really get into the book. So much of the overarching plot was spent going back and forth about Oz without ever coming to any real conclusion. I could certainly appreciate Beth's hurt but it always makes me cringe when authors rush characters into intimate relationships. It does not at all seem normal to me. I think the biggest issue I take is that the book suggests it's ""clean"" (no foul language, explicit sex scenes or otherwise) by saying it's a ""sweet"" romance but that certainly isn't the case. There wasn't a lot but there was foul language and too much description of intimate scenes to appeal to me as a reader. So, all in all, I gather that the sweet reference was to the lemon drops. Anyway, I appreciate all the hard work that went into writing this series but I won't be continuing due to the aforestated reasons.

She suffers all the humiliation from the Oz, the townspeople, endures manipulation  by his whole family and a few more, and takes all the blame because he feels guilty. He claims he loves her.

 My other most irritating problem with this book s the way the author simply betrays  Nash. His character changes dramatically from great and perfect t o putz. Simply because he is a city slicker.

1373,5,A3841R67V0G98O,B00BR70E2E,"Well, I think I am officially addicted to Captain Lacey Regency Mysteries -  I love them. The characters are just fabulously written - they have their flaws, make poor decisions that invariablly lead to not so good consequences (usually falling out of friendship, love or hurt) but somehow, Ashley Gardner manages to flawlessly ensure that things work out in the end. True to life when all is said and done - no matter how bad things seem, there is a way to work things out and then life is back to happiness and roses (well, mostly in my experience). This is one of the reasons I have enjoyed this omnibus edition of books 3-6 + 1 novella, so much. The characters are very relatable and likeable and the reader can't help feeling some empathy/sympathy for the characters when things go sideways. The main character, Captain Gabriel Lacey is the picture of a gallent gentleman who is kind to most everybody, even fallen women. His one flaw: his temper sometimes get the best of him.
In this omnibus collection, Captain Lacey lets his talent for  delving into murder and mystery, in the sometimes seedy underbelly of Regency England, run wild. Naturally, he goes about his investigations the good old fashioned way (afterall there is no DNA testing back in these times), by talking to people from all walks of life who may of known the deseased or those that may have knowledge of the crime. Using his strong determination and sense of justice, Captain Lacey uses all his connections amongst the aristocracy, his benefactor and friend Lucius Grenville, his magistrate friend and bow street runners to bring crimnals to justice.
There is one thing I will recommend, despite each book been self-contained with no cliff-hangers and that is, to read these books in order as there is a lot of back-story with the characters, particularly with Captain Lacey and his runaway wife.

I love to read and write in the YA genre, but it's rare that I come across a series that takes me into alternate world and completely captures my attention and fascinates me. The book has a mixture of contemporary, fantasy, and not exactly historical, but a bit of a once upon a time kingdom sort of flare. The world the author creates feels so realistic, you almost wonder if it's possible. Could it be true? And the best part is how the alternate world reacts to our time andplace on Earth. The characters are strong, and make you want to follow their stories, although Quinn (the heroine) gets a bit too weepy at times, considering the premise, it does make sense. William is a true, chilvarous, and very real hero that would steal any girl's heart. The other characters in the book are just loveable -to the point that you feel apart of the cast. It's just a marevelous story, and I admit that as I came close to the end, I already started to feel that pull of regret that I would have to leave this world too soon, so I turned off my Kindle, and ran over to my computer, and discovered that there are more books in this series to read! There are a few typos in the book, but honestly, I can live with that when the story is just so captivating. It's been a long time since I felt so pulled into a story. I vote for a TV series if there are any producers / directors out there searching for a new concept that's wholly fascinating. I just loved this series, and it is clean for any parents who are concerned. I'd recommend 13+ as there is a marraige and inference to private relations (but not any real content more than kissing and light touching). There is some violence, but it's nothing today's modern reader can't handle. It's rather tame really. This series is utterly fascinating.

The main character is Hannah and she was kind of cool. She was more interested in school and homework and schedules than summer parties and wildness, which I respected. There was actual no obvious character development from what I could see, but that was fine. Mostly because there was no need for development, it wasn't a thirty-two chapter novel about a teenager who finds herself. It was about down-to-earth Hannah who finds something to do while she wants for the last ninety-three days of summer to end. There wasn't much to her, since, again, this wasn't a long novel, but it was enough.

I think what I didn't like of anything was Hannahs mother, Coco. I didn't appreciate that Coco was almost shaming Hannah for not liking the party scene. Multiple times she asks or tells Hannah that she isn't normal or not doing what normal teenagers do by not enjoying parties. I have known teenagers who don't appreciate the party part of life and it wasn't as abnormal and unimaginable as Coco made it seem.

The romance was surprisingly subtle. I thought that this was a romance story so I had expected a lot more of the romance aspect, but the ending was cute. Would I recommend A Hairy Tail?

The Diabetic Recipes section has 13 Entrees, 1 Soup, 12 Side Dishes and 5 Desserts.

COMPLEXITY: The recipes were mostly easy to make. Other Paleo cookbooks Ive read can be obscenely complicated (who wants to soak macadamia nuts for 4 hours before grinding them into a paste?), but in this book the Paleo section stayed relatively simple. It made it so much easier to try the recipes.  The Gluten Free and Diabetic section also had simple recipes that did not take long to make.  All the recipes used mostly ingredients I already keep on hand, which always make recipes easier to make.

MY FAVORITES: One favorite was the Garlic and Parmesan Chicken Wings. Another one I loved was the Chicken with Cherries and Kale. I used fresh cherries, and the recipe called for them to be mixed with balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, shallots and pepper. It was an unusual mix for chicken and I found the balsamic plus the cherries and mustard gave it a really unique, unusual (and amazing) flavor.

This is my honest opinion of the book and I had fun trying the recipes. I hope my experience helps!","Easy, simple recipes perfect for diabetics!",2,6/14/2016

This series takes place in the small fictional town of Eagle's Toe Colorado. Living in Colorado myself I'm drawn to books set here, fictional or real.
After finding her estranged mothers house in disarray, and a secret message left where only she can find it. Ashley is worried for her mothers safety. Driving through her once hometown, she notices a security office and stops in looking for advice and help. She finds Thor (yes Thor, tall, blonde and blue eyed Thor). Who realizes whether her story is true or not, Ashley is scared. And he feels compelled to offer his help.
As payment for his services, Ashley decides to help Thor out by getting his mother off his back about getting married. She tells his mother they are engaged. That makes mom happy, but sets loose the crazy ex high school girlfriend. Who just can't seem to understand no, means no.
It's a cute series. Very sweet, very PG (which I don't mind). The characters are great, and they are written well enough that when I get to the end of a chapter I want to keep reading to find out what happens next.
I would like to see the build up to the characters falling in love, not just insta-love. I know the whole ""love at first sight"" is great, but I'd like more of the actual romance and inter action with the hero and heroine.

1407,5,A2CFRTLKV4YKJW,B00BUAZL12,"It has been a good while since I've read books in this genre, although I used to really enjoy Tom Clancy novels, but this 3 book set of novels looked good when I saw them, and I really needed something to read to get me away from the non fiction books I've been reading lately.  Wow! Did I ever luck into a wonderful series!  The writer is a former Marine, and I read that his books were initially books that he felt his fellow marines would enjoy reading. I feel he has accomplished that, and much more.  His books are just descriptive enough for you to feel you are there, but not overly descriptive to bog you down.  The characters are developed enough for you to feel involved with their lives, and the action is addictive enough to keep you up at night because you just can't put the books down.

Cal Stokes is the main character, and the books start at a time in his life where he is engaged to the woman who is the love of his life, and who actually gets him. He is going through a time where he is out of the marines, hasn't decided what to do with his life yet, knows he could go into the company his dad had built before 9/11 took his parents away from him, but doesn't know what his place would be there. Senseless tragedy rips his life apart, and he finds out just how much the company means to him as home and family as his body heals and his mind demands revenge.

These books, the characters, and definitely pulled me right into them, and I had a hard time putting them down.  I haven't finished books this fast in a long time.  I was amazed and delighted to find that this is the beginning of a series that has just seen the 13th book published, plus other series and short stories by the same author.  I'm really a big fan now, and can see a lot of great reading in front of me.

With that said...great action bringing the best out of wounded bodies and souls.  Foolishness in thought and deed are treated as they should be, sacrifice and love are dealt with in a way only those that have been there will understand. Possibly a little one-dimensional, however in this case... justified because of the subject matter as well as the initial intro of the individuals and situation and hopefully leaving room for growth in the series and characters.  I went through the three books in one setting and will grab the next two when I finish this review.
  If you are a northern California liberal you might want to take a pass on this series, you won't make it through the first couple of chapters without calling the ACLU and attempting to put the author in prison and demanding Amazon drop the books because of authors ""insensitivity"" for the mis-understood masses that are just venting because they have not been given that to which they are entitled.
  I recommend this series to anyone that has served or worked for those that have been under ""leadership"" that was anything but. The author has either studied great leaders of the past or was brought up in an environment that taught what Service, Sacrifice and Leadership was all about by example. No other way could he weld the characters together and make it work ... unless he has been there, seen it, and lived it.
  Thanks for the reminders of what true love really is and the sacrifice that He and my true brothers have made. My hope is that the rest of the series will help re-kindle the awareness and responsibility we have been given as we watch the characters grow and although the situations may not be the same, may we look for that which is ""just"" and seek to accomplish it in whatever we find ourselves involved, no matter how mundane....no matter the cost.

1411,5,ATZOHBDX5VNKJ,B00BUAZL12,"Be prepared for a spectacular series with military men (plus one woman) who specialize in taking names and kicking behinds. They work for the privately owned security company, SSI.

Mr. Stokes Sr., started the specialty security company after retiring from the Marines. It enabled him to spend time with his beautiful wife and their son, Cal. He employed loyal, honest and hard working men with military backgrounds. Many became lost or down on their luck after their time in the military and in desperate need of a second chance. SSI pay was more than fair, provided a home for them and their families, plenty of perks and ongoing training. The SSI campuses were designed & modeled after military bases and gave employees exactly what they missed from their enlisted days. As a result, employee retention was extremely high. They were thrilled to be given a second chance, love their career, be amongst colleagues who were also close friends plus all the resources one could ever want.

The missions or jobs SSI took were more about bringing the bad guys in and justice served. They follow their own company motto also known as Corps Justice. It serves to keep the USA secure and remain the best nation in the world. Book 1 introduces the reader to SSI and it's employees. Learn how and why the company was started, it's campus design and about the Stokes family. Books 2 & 3 continue with the same characters, introduce a few more and the missions are mysteriously complicated. Very entertaining, dangerous scenarios, details are gritty and characters feel like they could be colleagues or your next door neighbor. This isn't the typical genre I read, but I loved the stories and will definitely read more Corps Justice stories plus other works by this  author. Yes, 100% Highly Recommend!!

1414,5,A1C94J63JF64A2,B00BUAZL12,"After reading the first three books in the Corps Justice series by C.G. Cooper, I have to say that I'm impressed! The stories are about the exploits of Cal Stokes, Jr. and his men at Stokes Security International, or SSI.

SSI is a private security contractor who employs former military special operators from all branches of the services (except the Coast Guard, for some unknown reason). Their exploits are usually behind the scenes but none less dangerous or deadly. Their missions from Tennessee, Las Vegas and Wyoming display varying skills and levels of expertise. From protecting themselves, the President and taking down a corrupt contractor and his small army of evil misfits and terrorists.

In the stories by Mr. Cooper, the reader is privy to the brotherhood and camaraderie of professional special operators. Those men who are willing to face any danger to protect their country and their brothers in arms. In other words, true patriots.

I truly enjoyed the stories which are never boring, always exciting and within the scope of the settings, fairly true to life. Sometimes the plots get a bit over the top as far as 'reality' goes, much like the plots of the James Bond books. They do, however, entertain to the fullest. The good guys always prevail, sometimes taking losses, and the bad guys always get their just desserts.

In the second book, the USMC Silent Drill Platoon was an integral part of the story. I had never heard of this group, in spite of the fact that my Father and younger Sister were in the Corps. I looked them up on Google and found my way to a few You Tube videos of the Silent Drill Brigade in action. These guys are jaw-dropping impressive. For this reason alone, I'm happy to have read these books.

If you like macho men with guns who think patriotism and vigilante justice are synonymous, then these books are for you.  Don't get me wrong - I absolutely appreciate our military.  But I got tired of the message that the author kept beating me over the head with: if you're a civilian who is not willing to pick up a gun and go around the rules to get the bad guys, you just don't love this country... and you're obviously a Democrat.  There was actually a sentence in which one of the characters admitted he really didn't care what Democrats thought.  Seriously, way too much testosterone and right-wing conservatism for me.  On the positive side, there was at least one character I kind of liked.  He was a bit of a geek and worked in the lab rather than in the field.  But the rest of them were hot-heads disguised as patriots.  I can't count the number of times the dialogue followed this pattern:  A says something innocuous, B responds angrily ""what did you mean by that?!?!"", A says ""nothing, man"", B shrugs and says ""okay"" and then everything goes back to normal - the moment has passed.

My only complaint is that the story is too short. I  needed more to understand characters. Dale's hangups were quite straightforward. But Beth's almost seemed like annoying quirks she was too stupid to let go of. Too much was left for me to assume or imagine. Some flashbacks to her life with her parents and how she was treated at school would have been useful.

The book is titled The Mating Chase but the actual chase seems like a rushed afterthought.

Its only 99 cents for your Kindle, its hilarious, and its a short story by maybe the most gifted short story author working today. And really, that should be enough for you  this one is so much fun to just read and watch unfold, the language is a joy, its frequently laugh-out-loud funny, and the message is heartfelt.

But I recognize that saying all of that doesnt really qualify as a review, per se. So let me say a little bit more. And then, you should go buy it.

Fox 8 takes the form of a letter written bywell, by a fox. And thats important here, because the fox is pretty much self-taught when it comes to our language, so his spelling iswell, creative is  great way to put it. His language is always understandable, if not quite accurate. What do I mean by that? Well, heres how the story opens:
---------
Deer Reeder:

First may I say, sorry for any werds I spel rong. Because I am a fox! So don't rite or spel perfect. But here is how I lerned to rite and spel as gud as I do.
---------
Now, you might feel like reading that for any length of time would be annoying or exhaustingand yet, its not. Saunders walks the tightrope between comprehension and animal perfectly, distorting his language just enough to create a rich, fully realized voice without ever detracting from the story thats unfolding. Indeed, that voice is the source of much of the joy of Fox 8, as Fox 8 explains why foxes are very fair with the animals they eat, tries to bond with humans, walks you through his daydreams, and explains just how optimistic and happy most animals are. Fox 8, in fact, is an gleeful, happy narrator, and his constant optimism never gets less funny, even as he tries to acknowledge how bad things are getting for him.

Exactly what the story is here should be left to you to find out; suffice to say, it opens with Fox 8 learning how to speak yuman, and then reading a few signs that have appeared near the habitat of his pack. From there, the story continues; its never a complicated story, really, but Saunders imbues it with heart, thoughtfulness, and a rich humor that makes it constantly entertaining.

And then, just when you're settled into the glorious absurdity of it all, Fox 8 takes a sharp turn, one in which we find out exactly why Fox 8 is writing this story, and what he hopes to accomplish. It makes for an emotionally effective turn, largely thanks to how well Saunders has established our narrator and his worldview, and makes his reaction all the more understandable  and heartbreaking.

Fox 8 is, as are most Saunders stories, hard to pigeonhole. Its got a simple, fable-like quality to it that makes it completely appropriate for a child to listen, and indeed, theyll love some of Fox 8s silly asides and some of the windows into the life of animals. But theres something more profound and thoughtful underneath all of it, something that makes you realize that the story is deceptive in its simplicity, offering something less simple and fable-like, and something instead more realistic and complex. In other words, its another beautiful short story from one of the great writers working today, and a must read for any serious reader.","A deceptively simple, funny, complex story about an animal that learns English...more or less",2,7/23/2016

I anticipated a smart thriller and found a lot of interesting information and theories. Initially it was an action oriented page turner but I was surprised at all the violence and death throughout the story and as it went on, it began to lose me. The plot is too complicated and there are too many characters to keep track of who are eventually revealed to have other identities. The characters also don't seem to have much depth.

Their purpose was to manipulate the stock market. ""Think about it"", he says, ""Why attack New York first? They could have crippled us if they sent those four planes into DC."" David regularly breaks necks or randomly shoots people to advance toward his goal. And he's the good guy in this story.

If there's any science fiction in this rather vicious book, it's really hard to find amidst all the explosions and gunfire. The plot seems to be something about the ""great flood"" from 13,000 years ago - apparently Noah and the Bible were right all along. Something else about homo sapiens killing off the Neanderthals and ""Hobbits"" which is why we're all so inclined to kill each other in modern times. The whole plot seems to come from a college anthropology class, but I guess the author dropped out after the first lecture. Evolution doesn't work anything remotely like it's presented here.

The characters are one or at most two dimensional. The way the plot jumps around without any form of transition left me lost, then more lost, the dazed and confused.

I'm angry at myself for not reading the high placed low ranked reviews - and oh so disappointed to find a book with over a thousand reviews and ranked so high on Amazon to be such a poorly written, horrible example of a popular read.

At a certain point one has to choose to not think about those things too much and enjoy the ride. I am at present in the middle of the second book- the first ends on a cliff hanger, as I assume the second one will as well. It is entertaining and the premise is interesting. Long swaths of exposition sometimes slow things down a bit and seem to happen awkwardly at times. In the midst of great danger characters will start describing historical events in far more detail than is believable in the situation. And at times there is confusion as to whether someone gives someone the Atlantis Gene or if one is born with it and it is turned on by external factors introduced- and long after the thing seems to be settled a character who knows is still describing it wrong- which gets confusing. Ultimately it sort of becomes a Flash Gordon serial sort of thing with non stop perils overlapping each other and unlikely and constant escapes from death- like all the main characters are inherently indestructible.

I admire how the author incorporated some real scientific facts (as well as conspiracies) into the story. I think this gives the book an added sense of realism and even caused me in some chapters to think, what if this story would have actually happened?? That being said, I think the author may have went a little overboard while adding an influence of the aforementioned, and some chapters could definitely do without the added conspiracies.

Across the tracks, a beautiful sports car stops, and then is pushed forward from behind as an SUV slams into the back and pushes it forward onto the tracks. Lily instinctively jumps from her vehicle and rushes to save the unconscious man she can see inside. Dragging him out is almost beyond her strength, but at the last possible second, she yanks him free as the train slams into the front of the car, twisting and pushing it down the tracks.

When the ambulance and police arrive, they are both carried to the hospital.  Lily is treated and released; the man has more severe injuries and remains. The next day, a man comes to Lily's apartment with a message that the injured man wishes to meet her and thank her for saving his life.

This 'Accidental' meeting is the genesis of an 'Affair' that takes Lily to the wilds of Scotland and the depths of passion. The stranger turns out to be everything that Lily has searched for her entire life. The man, Stuart Watson, finds in Lily, the perfect woman to match the needs of his body and soul.

Under Umbrellas unfortunately ends on a cliff hanger, but it was nevertheless a really good read.  I have found that Emma Nichols' writing style really pulls at my emotions and this book wasn't any different.  I was upset over Blaine's callous disregard of Martha when she had a miscarriage and his even more callous announcement of filing for a divorce.  I felt all the angst  Martha experienced travelling to a new destination, where the only things going for it were the name, and the warmer temperature. I identified with her uncertainty as she started putting her life together in New Hope.  The love-hate relationship Martha and Joe embarked on was amusing and I could see how Joe was able to motivate Martha to stand on her own two feet.  Incidents throughout the book were hilarious, in particular Martha determination to operate a chain saw.  Joe's significant gifts to Martha were charming and made me realise the importance of celebrating milestones.  The small town mentality of New Hope was typical of small towns the world over.  Everyone knows each other's business, but when the chips are down, people rally together and support one another.

1499,5,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B00C8S9UXA,"I love when authors offer novellas or short stories related to a main series, but also separate from it.  Since such tales are unrestricted by the overarching storyline, theres more opportunity to expand the mythology and build characters.  The Grimoire of the Lamb is fantastic example of why this works so well.

In the Chronicles, all religions/mythologies/belief systems are manifest. So, along with the irish gods and goddesses of Atticus culture, we have Norse gods, Indian gods and more also running amok. With so many pantheons, its nearly impossible to give them all a chance to take center stage. In this novella, Egyptian gods are given their time in the limelight in an exciting tale of Atticus before the events of Hounded launch the series.

Atticus keeps a trove of rare magical books and when a dark wizard manages to steal one, he has to face the wrath of Bast to get it back.  This story was very well constructed, with lots of planning by Atticus to accomplish his goal  material I find more interesting than the action scenes (though they are also excellent!)  Atticus enemy is far more dangerous than he first supposed.

1502,5,A3HO83G1ORV7SK,B00C9DIBDY,"This is a deep and thrilling story about a flying disaster. The main plot is about a commercial airliner from New York to Scotland that becomes severely damaged in a midair collision with a military plane involved in the landing of a space shuttle with a nuclear weapon onboard. The damaged shuttle must land in Scotland, and the airliner's only landing opportunity coincides with the shuttle's. The airliner's interference may ruin the shuttle's landing, resulting a thermonuclear explosion. The shuttle's approach must be protected by diverting, shooting down if necessary, the approaching badly crippled airliner, which is low on fuel and carrying some 400 passengers, many badly wounded.

There are rich subplots, themselves thrilling, including those of flying the damaged military plane and of some members of the airliner's flight crew being involved in drug smuggling. There are almost too many of these related stories to keep up with, but they're all captivating.

As the book progresses, the flying of both damaged planes becomes so horrendous you'll have white knuckles on your armchair.

And, not to reveal too much here, I'll just note that the airliner and the military plane it collided with have one more encounter.

One spot of bother, Mr. Hough. I'm an American who often used to vacation in England, almost becoming a genuine Anglophile before you were invaded this past decade or two. Being a native Englishman yourself, with corresponding good manners, I was puzzled by your making almost everyone in the American Air Force speak as though he were raised in the southern backwoods of Appalachia (""I reckon I done seen that""). There are also a few snide remarks here and there from Brits such as ""Why don't they land their shuttle in the ocean?"" followed by ""Maybe they don't want their toy to get wet."" Not very sporting, old chap.

Nonetheless, in the book as in real life, the Brits come through big time for everyone, including us when none of our other so-called ""European allies"" will.

1507,5,A29MCZ55V6XTBV,B00CATSONE,"I love the message of this Book:
Being a naturally born Genius is a nice-to-have quality but is in no way a guarantee of personal, financial, or even academic success.
More importantly, not being a Genius by default but with other qualities can allow you to move mountains, innovate, and effect
positive changes to society and people's lives in numerous ways. If you have both - nothing will stand in your way.
Tesla in this story had to overcome many obstacles over the years including cheating partners and investors in his projects
to make his vision and innovations become reality.

The opening chapter of the book resonates very strongly with me. As a Physics and later Computer Science student I met many
'officially' brilliant guys and gals. One in particular who was a wonder-kid and studied with us when he was only 14, later finished
his PhD in Theoretical Physics at Stanford at the age of 20.
Fast forward 30 years, and you would think he would be at the top of the Academic world with more titles and financial success
than the rest of us have acquired. Not so, he was badly lacking in Social Skills, in financial responsibility and in Personal Maturity.
So in his mid-50s, he is a loner, political extremist, never had a family or personal life as such, nor is holding a steady job, and
his finances amount to no more than $20K in savings living in a small rented apartment with boxes everywhere.

The moral of the story is that smart is good but if it does not have passion, drive, focus, strong social skills, emotional health, and financial
common sense, one will not get very far even with 180 IQ.
On the other hand, if you are of average IQ but possess all of the other qualities, you have all it takes for a successful and rewarding life.

Lastly I should note that I am always interested in reading about great innovators and their lives - because we hardly ever know how hard
they worked to get their messages out to the world and be successful - and the book about Tesla is such an example. That's why I accepted
the offer to receive it for free in exchange for my unbiased review as shared above.", Lamborghini in The Garage or Subaru on The Roads,2,2/9/2016

I would recommend this for either right- before- bed, or on the beach, a quiet afternoon, etc. There are quite a few dynamic features to the story line. A few twists and tunes, and the characters are pretty well developed. There are a few parts that could be edited slightly better, but I do know most authors on here prefer for their readers to help them out in this aspect.
It was not hard reading by any means, but it was also not an elementary level book. Be prepared for some love scenes. But honestly, sometimes they do add to the storyline, right?
I hope to either purchase more in this series (if there is one) or get the author motivated to write more! Not that this was left with just a cliffhanger or anything, I have just loved how the storyline was developed, and would love to know where this could head into the future.

The second book in the series, as the author's blurb says, is both a prequel and a sequel, and one would think that it would be difficult to make the concept work, but Dubs accomplishes it with finasse. The first sections of the book are the 'prequel' and take place in the last few weeks of King Khasekamwy's (King Djoser's father) reign and the rise of Djoser whom we met in the first book. The prequel sets up the chain of events that will ultimately pull Imhotep and his family unwittingly into an assassination plot and lead to one of the darkest hours Imhotep will face.
One warning: there is a rape scene in this book that many readers may find difficult to read.

The hero is a fun, bad ass MC alpha, and the chit-chat between the MC brothers is hilarious. So if you can get past the flaws, it's a good read.

Does she invite them to the wedding they will have at the church? Please Kitty, write more here!!!! You leave your readers needing more of the characters you have created only to speculate and beg. I am dying to see Leo as time moves on and see how his love for Faith changes their ""play"" or makes it more erotic, passionate, or violent. How much further does Faith go? Hot wax? Electricity? Voyeurism? Does Leo invite his brother and partner to watch what they have, to, in some weird way, cement his relationship with Faith...to make it clear how serious and perfect it is...to make Ange know he truly loves and desires her so that Ange will know to always protect her? To make Ange understand why he, and Faith, need this relationship?

Eric is the young man on the white horse, so to speak, who can save her from public wrath and humiliation. He makes the offer that gives her the freedom to start over and no matter how she looks at it, she must make the move from England to America. This is the storyline in a nutshell! Eric cares for her and she feels guilty because of her poor decisions. It did get a bit repetitive in the middle of the book as it was the theme of her running away from those that care and the love of her life asking her to stay. About the time it got tiresome, the story took off and the ending is full of action and events.

Not only does the reader get a huge batch of thrills and chills, we get to know Franck and her family and her private life so well, which ads to the quality of the books. In this book things get really hairy when a young teen girl is taken from an outdoor concert. Yes, her family is rich and famous, but if you think this is a kidnapping story, you are so wrong. What this man wants her for is so sick that you have to read it to believe it. Of course, our heroine gets right in the middle of this house of horrors and there are so many ""ACK"" moments, that you better read it with the lights on. Another gem from this author.

""Why take that one girl and then why go back for the other"".  This is the first Rebekkah Franck book and now I feel like I need to read the others.  Although each book is a stand alone I get the feeling that there is an deeper underlying crime being committed or close to be committed by someone close to Ms. Franck.  Very good stories although the writing can be a little graphic for some.",Page Turning Suspense,2,1/7/2017
1534,4,A112JRLN4F6ZYQ,B00CG69E0I,"The story is well-written generally and compelling. The characters are vivid. I enjoyed the book, despite the grim subject matter and macabre elements. However, I did not realize that this is the first installment in a two (or three?) book plot. In some ways that is good, because there are loose ends when the book finishes, although the book can easily be read as a stand-alone novel, even though some of the peripheral characters may be confusing. There are also numerous typos that become somewhat distracting. In addition, some of the regular characters seem, well, out of character. Sune is not his usual supporting and understanding self. He is actually selfish and harsh at times. More importantly, Rebekka acts oddly. Her capitulation to her daughter's demands may be typical, but the child's demands here are huge. The kid is becoming a spoiled brat. As an aside, Rebekka has to stop drinking. She drinks to excess, gets tipsy and dizzy, and then makes ridiculous judgment errors, the kind of things that all parents warn their kids about. So, while the story as a whole is quite good, there are actions taken by beloved characters that just don't make sense. There is even a continuity error. Rebekka gives someone her card and then, when the person knows her name in a later conversation, assumes it is because she is a famous journalist. This is not the best of the books in the series. As with the Emma Frost books, Willow Rose started out strongly, but appears to have gone downhill. Nevertheless, while the flaws were irritating, I enjoyed the book as a whole.","Macabre Story, But Good",2,1/24/2016
1535,2,A1U9ZD4AZ5FNIT,B00CGFGS3A,"This reader truly wanted to like and enjoy ""Moonlight (Moon Series Book 1)"" by Lisa Kessler. Unfortunately, she did neither. Male lead Adam is a wolf shifter and next in line to be Alpha; but he was written and described in such a cowardly fashion - afraid to tell his pack and family members that his mate was a non-human, non-wolf female, but a born (not bitten or converted, making her a rarity in Kessler's world) shifter, this reader found him unacceptable and unbelievable to be the next Alpha. Also, in Kessler's world, wolves shift on the night of the full moon only, a single day a month, while typical lore has shifter's that follow the moon - as in, the moon dictates when they shift - shifting for three days. The night before, during, and following a full moon... so Kessler's creativity on that fell flat for this reader. Protagonist Lana is a jaguar shifter that spends the majority of the story claiming she's unworthy of Adam and how rotten her life is because she grew up in the foster system and life would be so much better for Adam and his pack if she would just leave... frankly, her whiney little butt frustrated and pi**ed this reader off to no end, enough that I just wanted to slap her and leave Kessler's world.

This reader doesn't really read many inter-species romances, although she does have alien's abducting and impregating her Sims quite often. That being said, the idea of a feline/canine cross was simply too unbelievable for this former dog breeder. Different species of feline would have been more acceptable to me, like a jaguar/lion cross, etc. But not a canine/feline... this reader simply could not suspend her disbelief and get into the story... furthermore, horses ""trusting"" predators? Had some of the horses on Adam's ranch snorted nervously when any of the wolf-shifter's or Lana entered the barn, it would have been far more believable for this reader. Perhaps my own knowledge of animal behavior played too strongly against the behaviors Kessler was describing.

There were a few grammar, spelling and punctuation errors found, mainly a missing word in a sentence such as: ""he"", ""it"", ""the"", or ""a"". Words the brain will typically fill in for a reader, without missing a beat or tossing them from the world. However, Kessler's writing style was nice and fairly inviting, and it was obvious she put a lot of thought and planning into the plot. It just really missed the mark for this reader; therefore, I cannot recommend this book.",Not for me,8,6/30/2017

I am thrilled that I happened to stumble across this series and look forward to delving into more and finding out more about the ""bad guy"" Nero.

All of Lanas life she has felt like an outsider, but after dealing with her mysterious illness that happens monthly (around the time of the new moon) for the past seven years she feels more out of place than usual. However, after learning that her doctors had plans on institutionalizing her she has been on the run trying to stay ahead of those planning to kidnap her.

While stopping to get some supper in Reno, Lana unwittingly meets Adam (a werewolf and the heir to his Pack) who is dealing with getting his enemies (the jaguars) out of his territory and had planned to kill her too as she was unknowingly his enemy, a jaguar. That is before realizing she is his mate. Together they try to maneuver their new world while dealing with those against their relationship at all sides and those still coming after Lana. Will they be able to overcome it all, while staying together or will be their struggles to much for them?

This addicting novel hooked me from the beginning. With Lanas sass and Adams charming determination the sparks flew and ignited the urge for me to keep reading, so. I finished it in less than 24 hrs. I loved the setup of this novel, it is enticing and intriguing to learn about the mystery of who Lana is and her growing relationship with Adam. In addition, the ending was good enough to give you a satisfying HEA while leaving the reader wanting more.

I recommend this novel and series to those looking for an engaging paranormal romance!

It is more of a novella than a full book, and it is fairly obvious that the author had just begun learning her craft.  The potential was also obviously  there, but the charm of the characters and the detail of the plot was barely developed.  It reads much more like a good first draft than a finished book.  Since it really isn't necessary to the flow of the series, I'd actually suggest readers give this first book a pass--it isn't necessary to understanding the rest of the series--and just delve into the later books, which are better developed and written.",The author was just learning her craft,4,9/22/2016

But I kept reading it and slowly but surely I found myself not being able to put it down. It's about redemption for Judas, for his betrayal of our Lord Jesus Christ. He seeks the coins of silver that were given to him for his betrayal, in hopes that he can give them to God and that in doing so he will be forgiven, so his soul may go to heaven. He is now an "" immortal"" his wounds are healed instantly and when mortally wounded he is healed but wakes up in a different place and time. This doesn't happen too often, and doesn't happen in these 3 books. The action is alright, not riveting but interesting. The stories he tells are very good.

Then, I got this three-book offering... and subsequently got the whole seven book series because, as the title of this review says, it's a surprisingly good read.

We all know about Judas' betrayal of Jesus, indeed making him the most hated man in the history of our species... but what if Judas hadn't just pass&eacute; always all men do?  What if his punishment was to not only be able to die, but if he wanted to die, he had to reclaim the infamous theory pieces of silver he was paid to betray Christ?  Now, what if he wasn't the only immortal and what if a lot of them weren't, uh, nice people and they wanted to make sure you couldn't reclaim your blood coins?

An artful, educational children's rhyming picture book designed for children K-3. Available in English via Kindle Format at Amazon World Wide.

Although annoying, this is a beautifully illustrated rhyming children's book and the entire premise of aliens coming and visiting Earth. The combination of aliens, earthly animals, fish, lady bug, birds, and even a spider, etc mixed with sight-seeing and rhyming story is the perfect way to keep children entertained for hours. Notable is the fact that alien and earth creatures responded kindly towards each other, and Moobala Schmoobala finding his best friend, Boobala, along the way speaks to children about getting lost. I think a page on safety regarding getting lost from each other and safety regarding this would be nice to add to this wonderful story, however, I love this book and I rate it at Four stars! M.

Its intention is to teach the youngest ones about our wildlife and the harmony of coexistence on Earth and in the universe.

But there is also one other lesson, or moral, of this educational story meant for us adults. As kids, we dreamed big and believed anything was possible. Our world was beautiful, innocent and perfect, full of all kinds of creatures, wonders and possibilities.

If we only made ourselves to see it with these eyes again, on our return to innocence we would realize how amazing, special and promising it still was. For all of us.

I absolutely love series books and cliffhangers!  With that being said lets say I am so glad I found this book once the series was complete because I immediately ordered the next book to start!  From the first page I couldn't stop turning the page.  The characters have so much depth and you cant help but feel that you know them.

Jennifer is struggling to find a job in NYC but not having any luck until she meets a mysterious stranger in the elevator when leaving a disastrous interview only to bump into someone leaving the building and everything go flying.  Little did she know that Alex Wenn the billionaire was her mysterious stranger she had just shared her horrid interview details with in the elevator and helps her pick up her belongings and resumes.

Another interview landed her a job with Alex Wenn himself only to end after one day when it brings back horrid memories of her childhood.  She walks out on her high paying job she needed so bad and refuses to talk to Alex.  She won't answer the phone and deletes his voice mails but Alex will not give up.  She soon lands another job and is loving it and finally falling into a routine when Alex shows up and wants to talk.  Jennifer is unsure but finally gives in to talk.  The struggling girl starting over in NYC has a billionaire at her mercy after her first impressions and he won't give up.

I fell in love with this book because it is more than just an erotic story or a simple romance story.  Both Jennifer and Alex have a damaged family history that both have locked away without dealing with.

1569,3,A3I9PUR2E3BSJC,B00CK8CL0W,"Pros and Cons is the second e-book novella to introduce the unlikely crime-fighting duo of Special Agent Kate O'Hare and Nick Fox, incorrigible con man. Set three years after The Shell Game, where Kate first encountered Nick, both the biggest break of her career and her biggest obsession, this short story gives a bit more insight into Kate's character. Sure, she's something of a walking chick lit cliche, from her junk food habit to her complete lack of personal style, but she's dedicated to her job and not above appreciating the Nick's flair for the dramatic...or his devilish charm and good looks. While the central con here is -- if possible -- even more ridiculously over-the-top, it encapsulates what I like most about this series -- the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously at all.

1570,3,A1OSGN6CVQIF7N,B00CKH4FAM,"I give this book 3 stars, because the writing is much better than the writing you get usually in those free (or almost free) books and the plot is actually interesting and evolved. It reads like a good book. But then, it reads like a good book for accountants or lawyers. It's not the usual language for science fiction. Instead of reading about technologies and science, you read about legislation and bank accounts and just blaah.

Then, I have objections related to the world-building. The whole world is too human-like. I didn't find anything original, anything alien. It seems like the author took atheists and Muslims, put them on separate planets, one of which is obviously the USA, since English is Standard language for the planet and the whole Universe (and the multiverse, I expect?). And the president of the League is american, the elections are american-style and well, everything is american. What happened with the rest of the planet is a mystery to me. Probably died of boredom.

And yeah, those americans are very very racist! To the point of getting ridiculous - I mean why would the whole galaxy want to emigrate to the USA/the Earth/ so that they have to build ghettos? What is so attractive so that they will accept to live like prisoners (worst actually), how do they make a living, when they are practically not allowed anywhere (unless they are rich and/or criminals, who are always welcome anywhere) and how is our atmosphere compatible with all those different species anyway?

Finally, the way the alien is playing secondary role in this book is outright racist. I mean the guy is ultra-tough Empire assassin but he leaves to the human with distant military memories to do all the fighting and is generally either helpless or useless the whole time. Come on. That part of the story is like ancient US-Soviet movies, where two agents have to work together, but of course, the Soviet one is a complete idiot.

So even though I liked the writing and the story is interesting, there are things which I simply cannot forgive the author and so I won't buy the other books. Not my style and not my ethics.","Interesting book, but way too american and way way too anthropocentric",4,10/18/2016

What I love most about her books is you almost feel as if she is writing a lot of it from personal experience. Lila is such a strong character. If half of what happened to her, happened to me I would be a puddle on the floor. I have to admit I had sad tears, and happy tears at times reading this book. I also LOVED how quickly she took to helping with Jonah in a sincere way. I also felt the pain for Lila's treatment by her old friends and the townsfolks and how unsupported she ended up being at the worst moment of her life. Colton was a breath of fresh air. I loved the way he kept defending her honor, yet giving her space and time. I loved her southern men characters. I can't wait to read the next book. All of Colton's brothers seem interesting.

They are a series, but you don't necessarily have to read in order, but it does help with character development.  These are the first 3 books in the series.  Miracle at St. Bruno's starts it all.  Bruno is a deep dark character with many secrets, but all the woman love him and the monastery worships him.  Lion Triumphant is my least favorite in the series because the female character is beaten and raped and falls in love with her captor.  Not the strongest female lead.  If you read the book in the mindset that this could have happened in this time period, you can enjoy the book and the writing.  Just think back to how things would have been then.

I have downloaded several others in the series and am really undecided if I will ever read any more of them.  This felt like the never ending book, it was way too easy to put it down for days at a time.  I pretty much forced myself to finish it only because I don't like leaving things undone.  As others have stated way too much talk of their food and snacks and how overweight they both are. The story just rambles on and on, too many useless details or scenes.  Can't stand the character of his clueless neighbor, so annoying.  I also don't care for it that the location for the town of Hilldale isn't identified.  One of the things I like best in reading is the ability to travel without leaving home, to learn about different places.  I get that it's a fictitious town but at least give us a state or part of the country other than an area that gets snow.
And in both the first and second books there are secret passageways??  Are you kidding?
I will say the books are clean, but being a cozy that's expected.  People are murdered but there aren't any gory details.  The gentlemen are Christians and spend time in prayer everyday.  Those are about the only positive things I can comment on.
I will have to think long and hard before I attempt the next book, if I do.  Don't understand how so many people are so enamored with this series, but then again, different strokes.","Free download, got what I paid for- too much talking about food.",2,2/1/2017

At least the CSB Holy Bible (2017) has an Index at the end from where one can access the different Bible verses (and yes, it is true from the table of contents one can get only to the chapter and has then to leave through the hole chapter to get to the verse. Additionally the font / printing that was used in the newer version has improved and with it the readibility. The new version offers cross-references, although they are only listed.

1586,3,A1J3CQAW3A4XHF,B00CM13NTU,"This updated text edition of the HCSB is optimized for easy reading on digital devices. Free from the visual clutter of footnotes, cross references, and other links, this edition is fast to navigate and easy to use.

The HCSB was developed by 100 scholars and English stylists from 17 denominations, who prayerfully translated what is one of the most significant Bible translations available today. The HCSB reflects linguistic advances in vocabulary, grammar, punctuation and formatting while it retains meaningful theological terms. In the HCSB you'll find God's personal name (Yahweh), the use of ""Messiah"" in the New Testament, and the use of ""slave"" in the New Testament, just to name a few examples. Also, you'll notice the contemporary speech patterns in the HCSB mean that words like ""behold"" and ""shall"" are not used. Instead, words or phrases that are common today can be found in their place.

The HCSB employs a first-of-its kind translation philosophy known as Optimal Equivalence, which seeks to achieve an optimal balance of literary precision and emotive clarity through a comprehensive analysis of the text at every level. This process assures maximum transfer of both words and thoughts contained in the original.
B&H has done a lot of work in improving the HCSB over the last year and a half.

The newest print and digital editions feature an updated and revised text as well as many formatting improvements.

These new formatting improvements are what makes this edition the best choice for reading on a Kindle. I've read the NIV, TNIV, ESV, NET, NLT and the CEB New Testament on the Kindle and none of them are as reader-friendly as this one.

What makes it so reader-friendly?
-The Chapter numbers have been made smaller and the verse numbers have been made lighter to de-clutter the text. By contrast, most other Kindle bibles feature large, bold chapter and verse number that get in the way.

-The paragraph headings have been left-justified and made only slightly bigger than the text itself which means they are less intrusive. By contrast, most other Kindle bibles have either double-spaced paragraph headings or centered headings which interrupt the flow of the text.

-On the smallest font setting, the text appears single-spaced and so takes up almost the whole screen making it look and read more like a book. By contrast, most other Kindle bibles appear one-and-a-half or double-spaced on the smallest text setting making for less text on the page.

-The table of contents is only two pages on the smallest font setting making it easy to navigate to the desire passage.

If you're looking for a good translation in an easy to read format that reads like a book and not a reference work, then this edition is for you.

One small drawback: While the publishers have gone to great lengths to improve this version and make it more reader-friendly, each chapter begins on a new page. So, for example, if you're reading 1 Thessalonians, Chapter 1 takes up a 1/3 of the page and you have to move ahead to the next page to continue on to chapter 2.

I contacted the publisher about this and they told me that the breaks are part of what allows the book to load and navigate as quickly as it does. That being the case, they welcomed my feedback and said that they would continue to wrestle with improving the reader experience.",Three Stars,2,2/11/2016

Does Ms. Woodson actually think that a man who literally takes a three year old boy from his mother's arms and kidnaps him is sexy and leading man material?  Once our goofy heroine (a countess, no less) attempts to reclaim her child, Lord A-hole allows her to stay but makes her an unpaid servant...What the H???

Oh, I forget to mention that our distraught mother/countess/servant was banging Lord A-hole within a few days of her arrival. That's right, sleeping with the kidnapper of her child!!!  Ick.  Also, the dude was pretty much committed in marriage to his Grandmother's goddaughter so why is he sniffing around Laurel and why is Laurel allowing it?  Act like a proud woman,  you silly female, you.

Another issue I had was Lord A-hole condoning and defending the cruelty shown to Laurel by her former sister-in-law.  Again, a perfect opportunity for the author to portray her leading lady by having her stand up for herself and hold her own against these odious people but no, the h just wrings her hands in despair and allows this torment to continue...stupid creature.

And lastly, when you think that Lord A-hole couldn't be any worse, he does NOTHING to help Laurel when she's arrested in front of him for theft and thrown in the clink for several days. Need I mention the deplorable and primitive conditions of said jail? Ouch!  But of course, our pathetic Laurel, when released, happily spreads her legs for him again...

I loved her independence and strong personality and 30 y/o MacKenzie Wyatt wasn't afraid to throw her weight around...even to her boss.  I loved that!  She knew her value and worth and used it to her advantage.  She's the character that carried this story from a 2 to a 3.  Because it certainly wasn't Ethan O'Connor....he was nothing more than a mischievous child and was a little dull (for me).  He's a mama's boy.  Ethan's a charmer...with his habitual lazy grin and green eyes that don't miss a thing.  He's a wealthy, handsome flirtatious playboy that is stuck on himself (and he readily admits it).  Women flock to him and grovel at his feet.  All except MacKenzie Wyatt, who avoids him.  To her, he's an arrogant, conceited jerk who happens to be her boss.  And Ethan delights in tormenting her.

Unfortunately for MacKenzie Wyatt and unbeknownst to her, he call's an impromptu press conference and announces HER to be his fiance'....aaaaaaaaaand her nightmare begins.  That was the gist of the whole story.  Ethan paying her a sum of money to be his fake fiance' to get the tabloids off his back.  The plot is a storm in a teacup...very little controversy.

For how much time this author spent drumming into my head, and expertly conveying and emphasizing (repeatedly)..

1604,3,ATZOHBDX5VNKJ,B00CNVVJ68,"A classic professor-student bit of erotica, but told in modern times. Lucy, raised without rules by hippie parents who believed in discussion vs. structure & consequences. She's uncertain of her path in life, so continuing her college education in the masters program with a focus on Business binds her time. An elective class in Victorian Literature isn't something she can pass up. Enrolled to audit the class, she is awestruck by the deep voice that reprimands her on day one for tardiness and making eye contact with the very handsome Professor Ryan Sherwood leaves her astounded. Called to his office for her rude behavior, she's chastised and her mouth blurts out if he will spank her. Looking up, she flushes at the images of a fantasy starring Prof Sherwood spanking her ivory bottom to a luscious pink. Dismissed, she rushes home and queries ""spanking"" on her computer. Reading several papers, she realizes her need for boundaries and Prof S is the man she submits to. Well, submits in her fantasies and replaces him in the plethora of images on her screen and in her fantasy dreams.

Warning, there is a major cliffhanger ending! The descriptive writing is just right for fantasy daydreams. Images of a talented, educated, strong, caring, tall alpha male makes for lusty daydreams and nighttime fantasies.

The story is fun, but a bit more development of Ryan would make this story even better. His issue of Paddled mag - not for canoe enthusiasts - was funny! Perhaps, after Jeremy is introduced, a conversation between him & Ryan about Lucy could've brought more clarity about his Dom side.  Jeremy's comment in the restaurant was too broad and almost unnecessary. I'm hoping the next book will bring better clarity such as if he's a BDSM club owner.  (My guess.) Additionally, the interaction between Ryan & Lucy starting earlier with regards to their closed door antics would have been nice, or even continued for a bit longer story. I'm interested in reading what's next, but not rushing to buy it. Giving the reader a bit more to make me crazy with need, similar to Lucy rushing home after classes is desirable.

1606,5,AEY21RGBPVYPP,B00CNX3V0S,"The perfect horror story with a spooky old house and a horrific storm going on during one night of hell.  There are four wealthy teenage boys, that are in boarding school, that are looking for their latest thrill.  They have formed a club and in order to be an accepted member, they must complete their first kill.  They have a fascination with the character, from the Freddy Krueger series, and even have a replicate of the glove he wore in the show.  These boys will dress up in the Freddy Krueger costumes before they go out seeking their latest thrill.  They pick a family that they want to terrorize and kill, and unfortunately, they picked the Lucas family.  The Lucas family consisted of a father, mother, 2 daughters, and 1 baby son. What the family was not expecting was to be attacked by the four young boys in a Helter Skelter fashion.  The youngest daughter, and the baby boy, survive the attack.  The youngest daughter, Ella, aka Humpty Dumpty,  will get her revenge on the four boys in a devastating manner.

1609,4,AIO247KHD2O40,B00CNXR8H0,"Rock-a-bye Baby is an entertaining short dark story about a control freak mother who will do whatever it takes to maintain the perfect life for herself and her family, while constantly worrying about her infant child which she pushes the stroller of everywhere she goes. She believes in perfection from others and must tell them if they are failing, such as a newspaper who constantly publish stories by a journalist with grammatical errors. The story is good, but a bit predictable and one that doesn't have a great ending, instead we just introduce a character who somehow has a past with the main character which we never really go into, who sums up what has been happening if you've been skimming or somehow didn't work out the obvious.  There's also things the character does where you'd imagine there would be security cameras and witnesses, such as at a child care center which while you're reading just make you think this is a bit implausible.

But it's not a bad tale, and is certainly entertaining. Could have benefited from being longer and fleshing out the story a bit more but I'll definitely check out other books by Willow Rose in the future.

Agnete  held a yearly lunch for her friends who had attended boarding school.  She was cleaning the house & frustrated.  The teachers were on  strike & her daughter was home from school.  She was also disturbed  by her daughter Emma's recent weight gain & her pleading for  chocolate milk too early to have it.  Her daughter's chubbiness made her  feel inept & not a 'perfect' mother.  She wanted to hide her from her girlfriends.

It started snowing & Agnete was disappointed because she would be unable to show off the garden to her friends.  Emma was thrilled because she like playing in the snow.

""Emma knew she  probably never would understand why her school was closed, but it left  her sad since she loved going to school.  Not so much because she loved  the school, but she loved being away from her mother all day.  She enjoyed not having to listen to the small hints & constant comments  about her size & weight & not seeing the disapproving look in  her mother's eyes every time she ate something.  Even if the other kids in school from time to time mocked her for her size, she still preferred  that over her mother.  Their disapproval wasn't as bad as her mother's.  It didn't hurt as much.""

Emma discovered a small,  chubby snowman & sang & danced around it.  Later she discovered  the snowman wasn't what it seemed to be.

Emma's mother came  running through the snow after she discovered Emma was not in her room.  Her maternal instincts were awakened at last & she feared losing  her daughter.

Ok, I agree that a paid for trip is not to waste, but her mother and sister are very wishy washy about the whole thing. First the mom is okay with it, but then she's constantly worrying - calling, texting and emailing her. The sister is adamantly against the trip, but then she's okay with it, without much prodding.

A content editor would have been great before this book was published, that's all I can say.

If you're gonna read this book because it's free, just keep in mind that it's more angst than it is love story. LOTS of angst. And wow, the heroine is mean when she's upset, but yet the hero still wants her??  Even her being angry had no real justification.

1624,4,A29N1LNF8PBE4U,B00COMWK3W,"I do believe that the author deserves at least four-star rating for this book, but I also believe that the tragic motivation given to our hero Will breaks from the tone of the series and snatches away any good feelings left by book 11.  While it was well written it reeks somewhat of ""girl in the refrigerator.""  If the author had set up in previous stories that characters could die then it would not have been so bothersome for an important character to have perished off page given the time jump in the series.  So while the book is written well it does feel like the author decided to try and change the tone of the series the last book . Which leaves a lot to be desired .

 That said let me tell you why you want to read this book. First and foremost this book does bring the series to a close that many readers wanted to see. That is to say Will gets an apprentice. The title of the book gives away the origin of our new apprentice and it makes sense given the progressive nature of the story what will make this apprentice standout. The relationship between Will and his apprentice is enjoyable and almost a trip down memory lane as they are many callbacks to pass stories. You will find yourself laughing and crying at some parts of the story .

 If this series had continued with the new apprentice as the  focal point then I think this book would have served as a great gateway to the second half of an awesome series. The location at the end of the series does taint my view of the work.",An infuriating but good read.,6,5/29/2017

She broke it off a few months ago, fond of him but unsatisfied with his lack of ambition. However, he hasn't accepted that it's over, which sets this book up to turn into the early stages of a love triangle  NOT my favorite plot element; I wish they weren't so common.

This story has a message that many are not getting. We are NOT past this problem but we need to and fast. Because when we eventually get to the military in space, they will have to have dealt with this issue. Women are NOT equal to men except for their brains and both sexes need to accept that and placement where they are most valuable. Men are stronger and they are better fighters and women tend to be more emotional. It's a fact and a danger on the battlefield. It is easier to win a war when every soldier is in the right position. The place where they are most valuable. The man in this story learned a lesson but he was also proved right. Thre are as many false sexual harassment claims as real ones and they do waste time and put everyone in danger. This is from a female perspective who has no ties to the military.

1639,3,A2S5EPJ451WL3I,B00CQUW9YC,"Saved can be told basically as a fairy tale, set in the Persian Gulf of not too long ago, between the captain of a US navy destroyer, and the girl they fished out of the Persian gulf in a dinghy. The story is emotional, but the captain is often difficult to like, having that chauvinist attitude. Yet his protective instincts are right on. The girl is both strong and horribly brittle and weak at the same time, which is the way a victim often are. The book is about how circumstances threaten to keep them apart.

Eric, captain of a navy destroyer in the Persian Gulf, came upon a dinghy in the middle of the ocean, containing only a single figure. The dinghy was recovered and brought onboard... revealing a very pregnant white girl, wearing a Middle Eastern full-body chador. She said she was Abby, an American visiting Paris months ago, snatched by human traffickers who sold her to a sheik, who raped her until she got pregnant, then beat her. She was recovered with bruises on her face and bruised ribs... and 8 months pregnant, and may have been adrift for days. As Abby recovered, Eric found himself drawn to the vulnerable girl, but soon Eric has to fight a sexual harassment charge. A female corpsman, who failed to observe proper protocol with the captain, and got a chewing out, decided that the captain's chauvinistic attitude (that females should be left protected at home to be wives) makes him the perfect target for her sexual harassment charges. And when the full story about Abby was out, CIA came calling as they found that the sheik may have been linked to terrorist plots against the US, and they want her as bait. Eric had to deal with threats from without (CIA and his superiors) as well as within (from his own crew, and the JAG investigating officer) as well as trying to keep Abby safe and deal with his feelings toward her...

Frankly, I have a little problem with Eric the captain. I don't see a guy with that sort of attitude and lack of tact rise to the level of captain. And besides, the XO is generally the person who deal with the crew on a regular basis. We definitely did get to see XO a lot later as he's the one who had to conduct the onboard investigation (Catpain obviously had to recluse himself), and the command structure on a smaller ship is obviously a bit more informal, but a destroyer is NOT that small of a ship. Assuming Arleigh Burke class we're talking over 300 crew, and in general XO is the one dealing with crew problems, not the captain. I have no problem understanding his protective instincts for females rather than accept them as colleagues. It's just an attitude, it didn't prevent him from doing his job. He's merely... blunt, which is why I don't' see him as the captain.

As for Abby... Uh... she's almost catatonic, then became almost codependent on either the captain or the medical officer. That is actually understandable. She was so used to being ordered around. It took a little while for her will to come back. And I know that they pretty much had to get married by the end. But with her dependency issues I honestly don't see her settling into the ""navy wife"" role as Eric will be away for months at a time. But perhaps being around other navy wives and families is what will give her a stable home to recover from her nightmares, so it's not out of the questions.

I guess my main problem with the overall story is there doesn't seem to be a struggle that maintains the tension. Things just... happen, and there was never any doubt it can go only one way.

I thought the book was amazing.  I am so in love with both Dagger and Ryan.  They fit well.  I had trouble putting the book down and finished it in less than a day. .... Yes its a little far fetched that Ryan came out like he did but its a novel and sometimes they happen how you want them to happen in your heart, not how they would happen in society today ... You really didn't get to meet much of the band at all and that's ok as long as I know their stories are coming.

Abby took a trip to Paris after her grandmother died. Walking back to her hotel, she was kidnapped, and sold to be a sex slave. She lived with her master for a long time. Any amount of time to live like that is way too long. It makes me sick to think, that this really happens. She managed to escape from a boat they were on.

Captain Eric Hamilton was the Captain of the USS Larsen with the US. Navy. His crew spots a life raft bobbing in the ocean. There has been no distress calls. As the Captain, his first priority is making sure his crew is safe. Thoughts of what happened to the US. Cole ran through his mind. He sent a search party out to find out if anyone was in the dingy. To his shock there was someone alive, but in bad shape. Abby was 8 months pregnant, and was very dehydrated. She couldn't say for sure, how long she was floating in the Ocean.

I loved the connection between Eric, and Abby. It was like love at first sight. Eric was very protective of Abby, and vowed to keep her safe. The CIA wanted to use her bait to draw out the people that had kidnapped her, and sold her. Eric wouldn't even think about it.
Every good book has to have its fair share of drama. Eric was honest, and let everyone know his view of females in the military. He thought they didn't belong. As you can imagine he has made a few enemies. One vengeful female thought she could get other female crew mates to band together and go after the Captain. When that didn't work, she filled a false sexual harassment report. One report like that could end a career. (My husband served in the military, and I am so thankful he never faced anything like that. I hate females that lie like that.) A jag officer had to investigate. You will just have to read, and see how it all turned out.

DCI Jones and his protg, Detective Sergeant Phil Cryer, investigate this difficult case, not finding a motive for this crime.

The story is unusual in that we know right away who the killer is. It's the police that don't know so we see how they use their investigative skills to find out who was responsible for the death. It was good to get the killer's and investigator's viewpoints.

Right from the start I thought that Ray Collins was a jerk. That wasn't a good start to the story for me and I was tempted to stop reading. But I did finish it and liked the police investigation aspect of this book. Other than Collins the characters are likeable making this a good start to the DCI Jones series.

He meets Cammie at his 30th birthday party that is thrown by his brother and his brothers girlfriend. He uses her to escape the live in nurse that his brother hired and go to the Hamptons.
 I loved Adam. He was the playboy that got around often. He wasn't really the bad boy but the spoiled rich boy. However, he has a change of heart and decides it is time to grow up and be a real adult. With all of his faults I loved his personality. He was funny, he cared, and he was loyal to those he loved. What he did for Cammie  to get her to fall for him was sweet, in a weird way, but still sweet.
 Cammie was the hard part for me. With her history of knowing Adams conquest and seeing him while working parties growing up has had her put off with him. Also, the history with her and her sister makes her pull away from him. I loved the scenes that she was opening up to him and being nice. It was the scenes that she was pulling away that I couldn't get over. When she was mean, she was really mean.

***Triggers physical & sexual abuse

Right off the bat, I like the premise for this story. We have Denise Cunningham, she's in a real bind. She's been laid off from factory work, is served eviction papers, has kids to take care of(on her own) and now the local biker gang wants her to be their drug mule. She's having a bad day, possibly life. There's just not enough wine sometimes Denise, I get it. *clinks glasses with Denise.
Now if this wasn't enough, lets add a sexy, yet clearly dangerous, LIAM aka William Walker Jr-VP of the Heaven Hill MC. (Keep your eye on Senior, don't turn your back on him!!!)
Liam likes(ok ok Lusts) Denise, but this is MC life, and the MC comes first. Liam is a hard man, but he is still a man with a conscience. He doesn't want Denise to be the abused by the club, yet he's not standing up to his father/Pres. There are so many feelings as I read, hope, fear, loathing, anxiety, dread, excited, the story just runs through the gauntlet of emotions.
Just to be clear, this is not a riding club. The Heaven Hill MC is gritty, raw, and dangerous. They will do things you will be uncomfortable with or be down right freaked out by at times. You can see Liam wants to get out of some of the nastier business, but he's not Pres., his POS father is. I just don't trust this guy.
The blurb is very well written and it's what initially attracted me to the book, the story is even better.
I really got into this biker drama. When Denise gets hit in the face, and I mean hard, by the MC Pres- I promise you I felt it. Yowzer. The setting takes place in Bowling Green, Kentucky; the author's home state so I really got a feel for it. I did get the sense from reading this book that there is a big difference between being ""city broke"" and ""country broke"". I'll stop complaining now.
Liam is pretty realistic in his portrayal, he's not perfect. He's not a cheater if that's important to you in a character, but he's not always able to be a nice man. Although he wants to be. This is real. Denise is in trouble. We have to hope she and her kids are going to be ok. She's not the only one, the eager beaver young reporter Meredith is in danger as well.
So, if you are down for a gritty, no holds barred, well written, super fast paced, hold onto the sissy bar for dear life ride of your MC life. Welcome! Welcome to Heaven Hill. This is book one in what is right now a nine book series.  #HEA at least for now.

So, yes, I guess the accusation can be made that to some extent, his character was sanitized and softened for the television series.  And yes, maybe Lewis is a shade more important in the television series, too.  However, I think he is quite well portrayed in the first three books when he is present.  People have written in review that Morse is much too harsh on Lewis in the written stories.  I didn't really see that... Morse was gruff, yes, but he also called Lewis ""my friend"" and seemed to think quite highly of Lewis (even if he didn't always say so out loud).  I found the reading experience enjoyable.

This was one humdinger of a crime novel with the police frantically, determinedly and logically following leads regarding a serial rapist who Roofies his victims.  DCI AJ Colt out of London heads the task force in his hometown where the most recent rapes occurred.  DC India Kane has no love for the superior officer who landed in her station and took over her case.  The fierce hunt continues and pressure increases exponentially.  Enough said about the plot.  Very intense at times.  Excellent character development, great settings (at least it seemed so -- I haven't been to these places but felt realistic).  The daily meetings and think sessions and relationships with the detectives involved -- superb.  I admit to it being a challenge for me with the British slang -- and I loved the challenge.

1678,5,A18QO2D5B6L4AS,B00CXAH1V6,"This female author certainly knows what men think like and how to arouse them too. This sizzling story of serial killers is absolutely stunning and cleverly designed in plot description.

A rapist is managing to use a date rape substance on unsuspecting females, then when they are unconscious he takes them to his various lairs, strips off their dresses and rips off their underwear. He froths at the mouth as he eagerly lines them up naked for his lusting and pleasure. However, first of all he sets up a dvd player with film to show pictures with himself facially unseen and raping this victim. When he has finished bonking, he takes away his film and player. Afterwards, a few days later he forwards a copy via post to the female victim, who is totally unaware of having being raped, and also a copy to the police chief of the area.

This creates widespread confusion and horror. Who will be next!

This rapist was also a tattooist and planted and created tattoos on to his chest pictures of every girl he raped, and there were dozens. Sometimes he kills a female victim, in one scene he pours petrol into her mouth to destroy dental records, this will happen after he sets fire to her house.

Every time he strikes the rapist leaves no dna records and the police are finding the searching baffling.

1680,4,A294TSE87PH123,B00CXAH1V6,"I had a love/hate relationship with this book.  I considered quitting early on, but I stuck with it to the end.  The book became more enjoyable the further I got into it.

I've read a fair number of British authors in the last couple of years, but there were some words and phrases in this book that I didn't understand.  I basically ignored the terms and don't think it affected my understanding of the story.

One thing that irritated me was the overuse of Colt dragging his hands over his face or through his hair.  There must be other ways for a character to show frustration, exasperation, or tiredness.

The author made some oblique references to things that weren't explained until later on in the book.  For instance, people were referring to someone as ""the hulk"" but it wasn't until Chapter 5 where the reader was shown just who that character was.  This happened quite a lot in the first 15-20% of the book, and I was totally confused.  I kept having to re-read pages trying to figure things out.  I was happy to find the entire book was not like that.

The book has a lot going on, and there were quite a few characters to keep track of, both in the police and in personal lives.  The police have been looking for an extremely experienced (37 cases) rapist for three years, and their investigation includes two new cases.  This puts AJ Colt and India Kane at odds but romantic sparks start to fly.  Kane's history is a mystery for most of the book.  Colt's relationships with his immediate family play a part.  All these personal relationships are a major part of the book.

I think a good editor could have worked this book into better shape, but I enjoyed it for the most part.  I have the second book in the series and would like to know what's in the future for Colt and Kane.",Good book but has some problems,2,5/12/2016
1681,5,AMHMMIV3YGBZH,B00CXUTARY,"This is truly one of the most delightful books I have read. The main character, Nina Bannister, taught English for many years. She thinks. She sees truths others may miss. I love the quotation provided at the head of each chapter so much that I copied two of them down as they resonated so thoroughly with my life. Nina keeps a box of emergency books, ""those which, read on a summer day with the  ice cream wagons passing merrily and balloons floating above the sailboats, were merely wasted.  This would be a Dorothy Sayers day."" It is clear that reading is important to Nina, books from which she receives knowledge, comfort, distraction from worry, etc. Some days simply require a book interesting enough to fully engage the mind, and Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey is just such a character.

The other quotation is from Author Unknown, but could easily have been anyone with long experience of village life: ""The best thing about living in small towns is that, when you don't know what you're doing, someone else does."" People in the village where I grew up said something similar, in that they read the weekly newspaper, not so much to get the news, but more to see who'd been caught doing it.

The character whose speech was heavily redacted due to her colorful profanities made me chuckle.

This book is exceedingly well written. The plot is psychologically appropriate. Characters are well developed, Settings are beautifully described. I give this book an A+ in my 14 single spaced pages of novels I've read since 2011 when I began reading novels on my electronic devices. I used to always carry a paperback to read while waiting in line, in a lobby waiting to see a doctor, dentist, etc. Even paperbacks when a sufficient number will be needed during travel become heavy.

1689,5,AJFY8VUUC1Y2J,B00D0IRYK8,"This is a short guide book that helps readers develop their intuition.

This is not one of those books that claim to help you forecast lottery winning numbers or become a psychic overnight. This is a genuine book that enables you to quieten down your mind, listen to your body and your inner self  where intuition resides and is ready to guide you.

It does not matter if you are a beginner in meditation or other forms of exercises in becoming more aware of yourself and becoming more authentic, it does not even matter if you just want to give this a try as a whim; if you follow the simple instructions and exercises, I am sure you will be able to start listening to yourself, find your intuition and grow to let it guide you. Peace awaits you. When you are able to respect, rely on and listen to your intuition frequently, you will find life much easier, because you will no longer blunder into people and experiences that hurt you unnecessarily anymore. Trust yourself. You know what is good for you. The Universe wants to help you live a full and happy life. Money, work, love, relationships and any other matters can be easy. Really.

I especially like the chapter on clearing out the clutter. Sometimes it is difficult to quieten the mind when thoughts and ideas keep floating up, but the author teaches you how to simply let these thoughts pass on by, and not give them any energy or power.

I gave this 5 stars, not in reply to the ones who chose to lower the grade of stars for things that had nothing to do with the book, but because I found the characters are well written and the story compelling.

No extra stars for a 'Christian' theme. The story is compelling and the characters are defined and the story well written. I appreciate books that have a Christian theme but so many are written from the perspective of preaching to the choir--they sneeze on each other and expect others to catch on to what they are sharing. I've found the same theme to those who don't believe.

I enjoyed this book. Maybe that's all I should say but there's a feeling that I haven't said enough. I can't convince anyone to see what they haven't seen or don't believe. But I can say that there is love shared in this book. It's not a Mission Impossible where you can 'choose to accept' without saying that you could choose not to accept. That's what I wanted to say about the negative reviews. The ability to review something doesn't mean that you have to choose the role of 'critic' as all you have to do and say. You don't give better reviews because it's aligned with your worldview. And you shouldn't give worse because something was shared that you don't believe.

The book is well written and edited.
The story is compelling.
The characters are defined.

Complain about what you didn't like but it doesn't change the truth of ^ those 3 statements. And it doesn't mean that awarding fewer stars makes a review better or real. Any more than my award of the maximum makes mine more appropriate.

But my 5-star review is correct.

That I am afraid, just makes for a lame plot and cheated the reader out of main character's various struggles to overcome either their own weaknesses or external threats to love.

WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD

ER Nurse Julie scandalized the town when she had to break off the engagement. When Derek and daughter Lexi was brought to the ER after a car crash that totaled their vehicle and left Derek wounded. Julie offered her residence to help them recuperate when she learned the Derek was actually on the run from his in-laws. Derek was a soldier that got the mother pregnant. He wanted to come back, but she rejected him. When she got cancer, she gave him custody of the daughter Lexi, but her parents disagreed and got a court order. Derek has no money to fight it in court, so he took Lexi and ran. Julie fell in love with Derek, and somehow convinced him to go back and face the grandparents. Grandparents suddenly had a change of heart, Derek got a good job, married Julie, and there's the happily ever after. Derek's conflict was solved WITHOUT his effort (or even her effort, much). That's just... lame plotting.

Julie's kindness, gentleness, and faithful prayers are good witnesses to Derek and Lexi. Derek find himself wanting to ask God for help because of her, and she talks to him about how God loves him and will forgive him and listen to him regardless of what he may have done wrong. No typos that I noticed.

Issues: The mechanic's name changing from Henry to Harold at one point. Some bits were a bit repetitive. I didn't completely get the issue with Lexi's grandparents, but was glad it was resolved.

His father is a consultant, and his mother is a lawyer who deals in high power cases, and he understands that it is his mother's job that causes them to move so often.  On his first day of school he is confronted by a bully and his followers.  One of the boys sneaks up behind him and pulls his pants down.  When he pulls his pants up, the leader of the group rushes him.  Benjamin feels helpless, closes his eyes and waits for the impact, and sticks out his hand the way a policeman does when he is telling traffic to stop, and the most amazing thing happens.  Even though he never touched him, the bully is thrown backward quite a distance and is injured.  Adults rush in to see what is happening, and an ambulance is called.  When Benjamin's mother shows up in the principal's office, the principal says something is to be done about what happened.  Using her lawyer skills, his mother asks if that means they want to know if she is going to file a lawsuit against the school for allowing bullies to attack her son.  She has the principal babbling in trying to answer her as she asks similar questions, then Benjamin is allowed to go home without punishment.  Benjamin doesn't want to discuss what happened since he isn't sure he knows himself, but his mom insists they will go to the hospital the next morning to see the injured boy and apologize for hurting him.  At the hospital, the boy's mother is in the room when they arrive, and Benjamin finds out the boy's name is Nathan.  They are awkward at first as neither knows what to say, and the mothers leave the room to let them talk.  Benjamin eventually asks Nathan if he has always bullied other kids, and asks why.  Nathan says he has, and he guess it is just easier to be that way.  Then he asks Benjamin how he managed to throw him without touching him, and gets excited about the possibility that Benjamin might have powers.  Embarrassed and confused, Benjamin doesn't know what to say, but Nathan keeps talking.  It seems that only Nathan knows what really happened, and Benjamin convinces him to keep it a secret from everyone because he doesn't want to be treated like a freak, and this is the first time it happened so he doesn't even know what to think himself.  The boys become friends, and the other boys in the group begin to accept him as well.  Nathan encourages him to find out what he can do.  Eventually, Benjamin learns he is special and does have powers, but he also discovers there are others like him.  Unfortunately, some of them are good kids, but some others are not and use their powers for personal gain.  This leads to confrontations, and eventually the knowledge that there is a war coming.

Ten year old Benjamin Dragon is a very bright child who has already skipped two years in school. He is the son of Tanya and Timothy Dragon, a powerful lawyer and businessman. Their frequent moves plus Benjamin's small statue and last name provide fertile ground for bullies. On the first day of a new school Benjamin is bullied on the playground. Egging him on to fight, Nathan lies on the ground bloodied and injured. But Benjamin is puzzled because he never even touched the boy.

When his parents urge him to go to the hospital to apologize, Benjamin discovers that he and Nathan have a lot in common. They become good friends, but Nathan is just as puzzled about what happened. When Benjamin is at the scene of a close-call car crash, and the car swerves away to avoid hitting a young girl, Benjamin begins to suspect he had something to do with it. Weird things begin happening. Benjamin swears Nathan to secrecy.

A strange old man named Kennedy pays a visit to Benjamin and explains that there are certain special people in the world. Some have the gift of healing, some the gift of growing, and others the gift of destruction, which roughly translates to telekinesis. He informs Benjamin that he will be trained in his gifts.

Benjamin is scared, but he is elated that he will be attending Camp Walamalican with his friends Nathan and Aaron. There he meets another gifted one named Wally who is a healer. On the other hand, Benjamin will come face to face with a destructor who threatens to corrupt him and destroy people that he loves. Will Benjamin learn how to use his powers? How can he adjust to living a normal live, while coping with extraordinary power?

Recommended for a middle grade, young adult and adult audience. The characters and plot are well developed. Addresses lots of issues pre teens and teens face like bullying, fitting in with peers, being gifted, and getting along with parents. Look forward to more in the series.",A MOVING EXPERIENCE,4,7/10/2016

The story follows, Ben, a young gifted ten year old adjusting to his latest move to a new school. He's likable, he's vulnerable, he's different, and he's gifted. It's this gift that is the focus of the story as it explores the trials of his journey to determine his path in life. Young Ben has some big decisions to make. It's an engaging read and I did find myself reading it whenever I had the chance. (Make sure you keep an eye out for the Hagridy guy.)

Good suspense, and the author didn't stay too long on each thing that happened, and something changed to raise the bar. I liked the characters, who all had their quirks, but that made them more likeable, and fit in with the sorry, and what went right for them, and for what went wrong.

I know the author says she writes in London-speak, which is fine, but the rules of basic grammar still have to be followed.  I will say it again:  ATROCIOUS writing (the horniest thing Id ever seenwhat?  Horny is not a sexy word, and in that context, all I can picture is something covered in horns, which isgross).  Repetition of the same words to describe the same thing (a personal peeve of mine), lack of apostrophes pretty much any time they should have been present...odd adjectives, or rather...abrupt adjectives.

1722,5,A1ZTAIWFNMV5C3,B00D4D71EI,"I recently discovered this author. I grabbed this book as my first read from her and I loved this book!!!

First character that you are introduced from this book is Madison or Maddy. I knew from the first page of this book that this book was going to be a lot of ups and downs for this character. I really enjoyed reading about her character and felt really connected to her. Just knowing what she had been through and how she picked up the pieces per say and moved on with her life. She definitely had people in her life that helped her move on.

Maddy has a chance of a lifetime to go on tour with a band and write a book about them. How awesome is that? A world of unknown. And experience of a lifetime for sure. With the help of her friend she is able to pack and go along for the ride! Little does she know what's in store for her.

I really loved the characters of the band as well. Of course Rand was my favorite - I enjoyed reading about him and how he was so mysterious. He seemed so laid back and easy to talk to. Maddy and Rand had some kind of unexplained connection. And, you'll just have to read their story to find out what happens. Once I started his book I truly hoped they would get a HEA! But you'll have to read the book to find out where their story ends.

The other characters of the band were great to read about as well - I only hope they get their own books as well!!

This is not Erotic Fiction.  This is (para)Military Sci-Fi  that happens to, among other things, take a completely unexpected and surprisingly piercing look at what a ""sex-positive"" culture would look like in a nearly post-scarcity society.  Turns out it looks like a lot of people having a lot of sex for a lot of different reasons, and the author doesn't think it's a literary faux pas to make sex erotic.

This is also a look at what might happen to a society after Uplift, and what might happen to one that was interrupted in the middle of an Uplift.  Unsurprisingly, that looks like conflict and loss, and the author doesn't shy away from that either.

And finally, this is a story about a confident, competent woman who finds herself a stranger in a strange land.  Her confidence is shaken, her competencies made obsolete, and she is forced to navigate a shockingly different culture with its own strengths and weaknesses to regain both.

Fighting Destiny was an exciting, fun, sexy page turner that I couldn't put down. Some parts needed a LOT of work, such as multiple grammar mistakes and a few abrupt scene shifts that had me going back to the beginning of the paragraph to see if I missed something, but overall, I definitely enjoyed this read!

I would have loved more world building. I felt like too much of it was skipped over and we didn't get a clear picture of how the Otherworlders came to be so prominent in the Human world. But the creative story itself, more than made up for the lack of world backstory. Not to mention, the characters were so much fun! All of them.

In this world, Humans know about the Otherworld as the Fae, Witches and Vampires live amongst them, with the Guild there to protect the Humans. Synthia is a Witch, working for the Guild and shes just been assigned to steal the Dark Princes crown right from underneath his nose. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned, the past comes back to haunt her and in the end, her life and the life of her coven is irrevocably changed.

Synthia, aka Syn, has a deeply tragic past thats left her distrustful and suspicious of everyone and everything, especially Fae. But she gives everything she has to protect others, especially when it comes to her small coven of three. I loved her snark, her fire and her overall character. She was sassy and didn't take shade from anyone, including Ryder, the Dark Prince, who has decided she is destined for his bed!

This book is told mostly from Synthias POV, but we get some of Ryders thoughts, which was eye opening and so enjoyable. Hes got a lot going on, secrets hes holding close and walls hes not willing to let fall.

Watching as Syn and Ryder fought against their feelings, their hatred for one another and then ultimately, giving in and falling into bed together was sexy, super hot and seriously intense. I loved the slow build the author gave us. There was so much sexual tension and the build up was fantastic! Their chemistry was AHHHH-MAZING!

And behind all the sexiness, there is intrigue, secrets to uncover, gruesome murders to solve involving Fae and Witches ... and it all seems to revolve around Syns past, making her a target, too.

I really enjoyed this read. I fell in love with Syn immediately and I loved Ryder's mystery and intense brooding. That Fae is straight up alpha and determined to get Syn, who intrigues him so much, under him in his bed! Yum! And after the cliffy at the end of this book, Im ecstatic the next book is already waiting on my ereader!","""... sexy, super hot and seriously intense.""",3,9/22/2017

1732,4,A2IIX4K4UW34L1,B00D5M4PTM,"I'm not really sure how to review this one as I have pretty mixed feelings (total understatement). This is probably the first book I've ever read that instantly went from one to five stars in a blink.  Let me start by saying, the first part left me pissed off and caused irreparable damage to my opinion of the characters. The second part was absolutely riveting and left me wanting more. Not much of a grey area or transitional writing here. Hutchins wasn't kidding around when she warned this book would make you want to ""scream at the author"" (among other things in her 'side effects' blurb). Because I did. A lot.

I kept reading the neon signs of other reviews flashing: ""18+!!!"" so obviously my perverse mind is rubbing its grubby little hands together going ""oh goody, great sex scenes!""... yeah, that little hope died soon after I realized that along with them there's some pretty detailed gruesome scenes involving rape (mostly threats), lots of people being gutted, flayed, brutalized and all around violent shenanigans. So yeah, WARNING  if none of that sits well with you. Well, obviously it shouldn't sit well, but you get my meaning.

It was really difficult for me to get past the first half of the book (it gets better though).  I was actually pretty outraged in between wanting to throw my iPad across the room but for some reason I couldn't stop reading. Wow, the description is pretty misleading. There's nothing fun or playful about this book. Make no mistake, this is a Dark Romance. I'm not even sure 'romance ' applies- there's nothing romantic about Syn and Ryder's relationship- just an innate, insane, hate-filled attraction they fight with every fiber of their beings, in between the head games and violence obviously. There's also a pretty consistent theme of being powerless in this one which didn't sit well with me. The people Syn surrounds herself with seem to constantly take away her agency or in Ryder's case, her free will in general and she blames herself even though nothing is as it seems.

Fae have the power to take away your control and are able to rape (their description, not an exaggeration) you and feed off of you while making you beg to be tortured, stripping away your free will and your humanity, leaving you an empty shell. This isn't some: ""oh, they have the ability but never use it because they have a conscience"" situation, oh no....they revel in it. They use it for power, for leverage, for boredom, for fun. Sex is how they feed. They feed off emotions and essence. They even have a term for this outcome: ""FIZ"" (Fae Induced Zombie). Granted it's not always to that extent but apparently this is all semi normal and no one but our heroine Syn seems to care and only because she's considered ""damaged""... how is any of this normal or ok either way? She witnesses this first hand as a child as they brutalize and destroy her mother and kill her father.

Now she's coerced, threatened and blackmailed on all sides to become the Dark Prince's property under contract as both Ryder and her OWN Guild force her into this contract through threat of harm toward her friends. Why does he need her? You'll have to see. She's not told any of this is for ""the greater good"" or a worthy cause either. You know, something worth sacrificing someone you care about over? Nope. These people are suppose to be her friends- people she'd give up everything for. All I saw at first were people who generally lied to her, kept her in the dark, tried to convince her not to make ""stupid"" decisions ( these were generally in protection of herself or others) while patronizing her and people who simply use her. All of them. I just don't get it. Her coven leader is abusing his power, her enemy now owns her and all the while everyone is slowly urging her into a corner of alienation and submission and she lets them. And see, here's the confusing part for me... She has the power to stop all this, and take control back but she just rolls with it because she has some sort of misguided trust in the people around her. How? Not a single person's intentions have been for her own well being or given her a genuine reason to trust them or so it seems at first. Why the hell is she still with any of these people? She lets them in because she has no one else.

And Ryder -seriously? She has this insane attraction to this guy when 99% of the time, he is literally threatening to rape her (he never does, surprisingly and thankfully), demonstrating his ability to remove her free will to just prove her insignificance, or generally just trying to eff with her head (and not in a playful cat and mouse kind of way either)....Oh, but he's just so handsome, with such sexy lips....Get a grip! I truly wanted to pop right on in and punch her...if I didn't already feel sorry for this girl. Their relationship develops as each tries to fight the other's nature and their own. Except he's so much more than he pretends to be. I can't really say more because they're still not ""together"" by the time this ends.  These two seriously need counseling!!

Somehow (not really sure how or when) the story takes a 180 and all of a sudden, her friends are there for her, Ryder's not really such a bad guy after all(err maybe even worse)- they're actually perfect together (never thought I'd think that...ever) and the book starts to pick up with this insanely riveting developing story and ensuing relationships how it SHOULD have been since the beginning imo. I calmed down a bit after this drastic change in 'schitzo character development land' and realized something HUGE was going on but jeez! SOME of their behavior can be attributed to the events that follow once the thread starts to unravel and more is revealed but certainly not all. Just makes my head spin and can't detract from first impressions. But by the end, my traitorous conscience had abandoned me completely because it was so soooo epically good!  Pretty sure this book is turning me into a masochist....

And on that note....now I want to read the next one asap.

The writing itself: the world and character building are excellent (even if I don't always agree with said characters) and moves at a fast-clipped pace. What I can't stand: short, succinct paragraphs-If you can call them that- Note: a paragraph has 5 sentences or more at a MINIMUM.  Double spaced separation of short blurbs in a full length novel really just disrupts the flow. I couldn't get use to it even after 400+ pages.",When Worlds Collide- You've Been Warned (for soooo many reasons)........,3,5/24/2017

So when my buddy suggested this series, I downloaded it right away. Boy, was she right. This book is awesome, I couldn't put it down. I spent late night reading and couldn't put it down until the end. I tried to go to bed early to save the rest of the story for the next day, but my mind wouldnt let e. I read and I read until I was done. Love this book.

A love story about how a fae and a witch fell in love, was so addicting. Not only was the story so intriguing and it was so sexy. The heroine was strong, sassy and demanding. Then theres the Prince of the Dark Fae, wow. He was one hot man, who demanded attention. Their first meeting was melt you panties hot. Im not usually a dirty story reader, but sometimes the story demands it and this series really did. I love that the story was driven by sex, but was driven by a really really good plot.

I actually enjoyed reading this book. Some parts did get me annoyed but, overall, it was a fun, sexy read. The pace of the book is fast so you definitely don't get bored. I do like the storyline and want to see where it leads

This book is about Synthia, a witch who works for an organization called the Guild. The supernatural community have been outed to the humans a long time ago. While some humans are vary of them others are ok and are even working side by side. Syn is part of the task force that keep the humans safe from anything supernatural. She and her small coven are very tight. A strange & dangerous assignment gone wrong gets her directly into the path of the fae Dark Prince Ryder AKA who is also s** on a stick. The fae in this book are deadly and usually keep to themselves in the human world. However, Ryder is not your typical fae. He is a full blooded fae, an ARSE, HOT, very powerful, dark and deadly. He has his own secrets and he definitely wants Syn to work with him. Syn, on the other hand, HATES Fae. She has her reasons and yes, we do find out why. Fun, fun, fun....

There were lots of ups and downs in the book and a lot comes to surface. Syn is very powerful and there are some things she can do that is quite unique to her. There's a mystery surrounding her as well and we do get a glimpse of it in this book. (I already suspected though). I enjoyed her character cuz she's strong and sassy without being obnoxious. She doesn't take crap from anyone and yet there are times she cannot help herself with Ryder....well, it kind of sucks cuz of the power Ryder wields. She fights hard though.

The book is in Syn's POV with few chapters in Ryder's POV. I had to remind myself that Ryder is not human and to keep it in perspective. There is definitely more than meets the eye going on with him. I liked that both characters are not perfect, fluffy people. They each have their flaws and strengths. I definitely liked some of the side characters - Adam (who is Syn's friend and part of the coven), Larissa, Alden (who is her uncle and mentor), Ristan - freaky demon. I actually liked Ristan. He's definitely something.

This makes him an ideal hero in my eyes because he shows how deeply he cares for Syn while still retaining his strong personality. And, Syn.... She is my hero. Once again, Hutchins knows just how to balance out Syn's kick a$$ attitude with a vulnerability that makes her likable and relatable.

The characters had no substance except anger or sexual thoughts and or actions. I was disappointed.  I tried to read the second book with no success.

1738,5,A3VM0XN0MGWC0X,B00D5M4PTM,"If I was making a list of my top ten favorite series, the Fae Chronicles would garner a high spot. When it came to my attention that we did not have a review for Fighting Destiny, I was jumping for joy that I had a reason to revisit this series. This book is so good, even on a reread and I know whats coming I find myself just as blown away emotionally as I did the first time around.

For me, it does not get any better than both Ryder, the Hero, and Syn, the heroine. While we are talking top ten lists, both would top my favorite character lists, possibly edging out my favorite Kristen Ashley characters. That is saying something. Not only were they amazing, they fought their attractions with everything they had because they were against what the other person was at the most basic level  fae and witch.

Syn's life was a train wreck from the very beginning, but witnessing a group of fae kill her parents is what shaped her. A witch with unbelievable power from a young age, she worked hard to become someone who protected the humans from out of control fae. When others would have broken from the trials, loss, and heartbreak she suffered through, she not only endured, she came out stronger. So fearless, the only weakness she has is the ones she loves.

Ryder was walking talking sex on a stick and grade A prime stubborn alpha male. In fact, Im not sure Ive ever read a character who epitomized the tag of alphahole more than Ryder. He was strong, powerful, and did not care about anything but his people and his objective. Of course, this means I love every inch of the overbearing jerk. As the Dark Prince, he considered humans and witches beneath him and it showed. He knows when everything is said and done, and the game is played out, Syn may very well hate him but he just doesnt care because she is his and that is all that matters.

One of the best things about this book is that nothing was as it seemed, including Syn and Ryder themselves. There were twists, turns, and surprises with the turn of every page. Ms. Hutchins introduced me to a world that just sucked me in and won't let go. This is the only series that had cliffhanger endings that I religiously kept up with. The good news for you is that when you're left hanging, the other books are one click away.

Fighting Destiny had me smiling, cheering, but it also completely gutted me. In fact, Ive read it umpteen times and still found myself in tears, its just that powerful. If you haven't read these, you need to.",5 Cant Say Enough Good Things About This Book Stars.,7,1/20/2017

Then, finally I had to take a few cold showers due the angst and ignited passion between Syn and Ryder.

1740,1,AIETQ2OOGUA7I,B00D5M4PTM,"This is a self-pub debut novel and part of a series. Even after revision, lots of errors remain, grammatical (e.g. ""if I was"" instead of ""if I were""), extra words etc. The choice of tense is strange - hero's POV is present, heroine's POV is past and then sometimes all mixed up. The author uses a very limited vocabulary and the writing style is urban slang with repetitive usage of words (e.g. 400x f***, 79x beautiful, 32x mumble, 39x pet, 22x shiver, 16x puppet, 129x whisper). Sentence construction is awkward and sometimes indecipherable. In addition to an abundance of superficial pop psychology there are many cliches. The book abounds with almost sex and at about 70%, pages of pages of explicit sex. I guess this qualifies as mild erotica but the writing is not appealing at all. The heroine is weak and TSTL and the hero is asinine. Too bad, the book has an interesting plotline but is severely limited by the lack of development of characters and clumsy prose. I think the author is aiming for mild BDSM but it comes across as amateurish. She also thinks it is titillating to write about rape and submission fantasies but the overall impression is repulsive. The plot has major holes: what was the reason to have a fake Light Heir made up of body parts from different donors? Much is not explained.

I like reading because I think the written word is so much freer, and amenable to imagery and imagination. This author has no clue as to the power of the written word: she should go to creative writing classes or read the work of better novelists to improve her style.

Yay!  I was so needing a good one and it's a series so more to come; I'm so excited! Don't get me wrong, it is what it is so I won't be recommending it to all my friends but I was quite entertained. Even shelved my on deck to continue the series.

<I>Fighting Destiny</I> is similar to the Anita Blake series, not copycat just similar in outline (minus the MC promiscuity and shape shifter overload- thank you, thank you).

Badass but troubled heroine, villain love interest, viable conflict, adequate world building, and personable secondary characters (and bonus a great playlist), what more could you ask for in this genre?

I can always nit-pick but really my only mentionable grievance is that the erotica seems forced.  It's not terrible but it comes on strong early and it's more sexual than sensual.  Make no mistake this is not a little naughty, it's dirty and vulgar at times. As I said, it is what it is.

Summary- Promising story,if not for the sex, sex, sex, violence, main character's best friend's torture, more sex, confusion, lameness, bad ass demon that didn't rise to the occasion, whining,sizzle, pop, then finally fizz! Sorry not even the sex scenes could save this novel they were over the top and I feel it took away from the story-line. Ryder and Syn didn't have to go at it all the time for the author to convey to the reader that they were hot for each other.

It became so redundant I started skipping through every time they had sex, which was too often! I'm sorry Ms. Hutchins a great paranormal novel doesn't need sex to sale it needs strong characters that develop to keep your readers interested.

I can't begin to say how ticked off I am for purchasing all of the books in this series. Vampires, Demons, Witches, Angels, Mages, and Goddess were all through this novel which in my opinion felt like over kill the only creatures missing were werewolves, ogres and dragons.

I wish the author had taken the road less traveled with a phenomenon paranormal mystery instead of (Fifty Shades Of Grey Pt. 2), she didn't and the story suffered for it. I will not buy any more novels with these characters because they didn't hold my interest enough to see if they will triumph in the end. The story was going into too many directions and not any that had a solid foundation to see if it will have a HEA.

1764,1,AQS44IXMB0CSZ,B00D99V878,"I want to deal with this book from two perspectives, the story and the theology.

Story
This book starts out horrendously. Two men, out on the sea fishing, rescue a woman from the water. She had jumped from a cliff into the water; she had been in the water, made rough by an approaching storm, long enough to be driven a mile from the cliffs; she had then been caught in a fishing net along with fish and debris, unable to swim while tangled in that way; yet for all of that, the story doesn't show her having been anywhere near drowning. Her rescuers didn't need to do anything like try to remove water from her lungs, they don't need to try to get her to a hospital, they don't even bother to ask her about her physical condition because it's plain that she's no worse off physically than if she'd just taken a dip in a swimming pool. I almost gave up on the book right then, because that made no sense at all.

And what was that ending? It looks like the big fight is about to begin, then there's a cut to someone in another place, then...the end? What?

There is an incident, where a group is trying to rescue a character from kidnappers. When one scene ends, the rescuers are fighting the kidnappers, and seem to be winning, and they're telling the kidnapped person to run for an exit. When the book returns to this scene, all the rescuers and the kidnapped person have been captured by the kidnappers, and no explanation is given for what happened.

The romance angle, small as it was, was forced and contrived.

And the crying. I don't think I've read a story with so many characters crying. I didn't find it emotionally moving at all.

Theology
Though the locations in the book are likely not real-world locations, the setting is very much real-world, complete with telephones and televisions, automobiles, highways and convenient stores, and mention is made of real-world locations like Italy and Greece. It's important to note this, because there are three real-world things notable by their absence, especially in a story that claims to be Christian.

One is churches. In the town and city where most of the events take place, there is not mention of churches. It's never mentioned that the Oneness cells are associated with a church, or that their people go to any churches. And if the Oneness is suppose to represent the Church as a whole, I'm unconvinced.

Another thing is the Bible. There is no hint that the Oneness people study scripture in any way, but they instead rely on messages they get in their feelings, dreams and visions, and the like. In other words, there is no objective Word of God they can point to and rely on, only what one persons feels or claims to have gotten from the Spirit. It's no wonder the Oneness people spend this entire book being hoodwinked and bamboozled.

The third real-world thing missing from this book is Jesus Christ, and this is especially important when it comes to the getting into the Oneness. There is a scene where the two men, the fishermen who rescued the not-drowning girl from the sea, are talking with some members of this Oneness, and they ask about how one becomes a part of this Oneness.

To fully appreciate the answer they received, I want to try a bit of a thought experience. Think about the biblical account of Paul and Silas in Philippi, recorded in Acts 16. Paul has cast a demon from a girl who was being used as a fortune teller, he and Silas have been beaten and thrown into the inmost part of a prison, where they've been praying and singing to God as the prisoners listened in. And earthquake has come, they've been freed from their bonds, and Paul has called out to the jailer, telling him to not harm himself. The jailer has himself led Paul and Silas from the place they had been kept, and asks, What must I do to be saved?

Or, think about Acts 2, where Peter has just preached to the crowds in Jerusalem, and many of them asked, What shall we do?

Now, at this point, imagine that Paul's or Peter's reply to these people had been...

That is a mystery. No one really knows. (Kindle Locations 1196-1197) ...You will know when the Spirit is seeking you. At some point you yieldor you dont. The moment of yielding is the moment of birth. (Kindle Locations 1208-1209)

This isn't the gospel. The gospel is that we are sinful and rebellious enemies of God; but God, in His great love for us, has sent His only Son, Jesus the Christ, into the world, to live a sinless life, and die as the perfect sacrifice for our sins; that we can be forgiven of our sins, not through our works, but through repentance and faith in Christ. The proper response would be to repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, not some kind of vague notion of yielding which cannot be found in scripture.

Conclusion
I simply cannot at all recommend this book. The story is moderately interesting, some of the characters are moderately sympathetic, but I've read much, much better. I can't even say it was light, fun read. And the theology throughout is so very bad, it might be trying to cover itself in a few thin rags of biblical-like ideas, but in the end it's barely Christian at all. This is one to skip, and I have no intention of continuing the series.",that's not the gospel,14,5/27/2017
1765,3,A2X8144LP1BXFP,B00D99V878,"From a story-telling aspect, this novel was fairly good, although there were a number of areas I can only describe as ""skips"" -- happenings that just don't follow logically or people that do things without a well-developed motivation.

However, I was really disappointed in it from a theological standpoint. I don't refer to doctrinal differences here, but to the strange way the author ends up portraying God as an aloof tormentor. For example, once a member of the Oneness (essentially a metaphor for the Church), individuals cannot change their mind, even to the point of being forcibly retained. And joining the Oneness has nothing to do with wanting a relationship with Christ, a need for salvation, repentance, recognition of sin -- none of that comes into play. People simply join because they like the lifestyle and sense of community.",Disappointed,7,3/10/2017

However, this just isn't one ship, or one person left stranded on the planet known as Crashdown. Oh no, the wormhole spits out wayward ships on a regular basis (along with meteors and other assorted space junk). There is a whole community of Robinson Crusoes, some living in the settlement of Cratertown, others reside in more remote villages, and some live alone in the forests surrounding the area where the stranded ships crash land. And that is just the premise. Author Moon has a lot going on in this excellent military sci-fi/fantasy novel. Kin Roland, Cratertowns security chief, is known as the Enemy of Man, for what he did or didn't do during a not one hundred percent successful military operation against the homeworld of humanitys arch-enemy, the Reapers (who also are the enemy of man). But that happened before he was marooned on Crashdown. And Droon, a surviving Reaper (from the failed operation against his homeworld), is on a quest to kill Roland. Of course, Droon is also deposited onto Crashdown. And here the plot coagulates. The story is told from both Rolands and Droons perspectives.

And there are many conflicts, far beyond the Roland/Droon situation: interstellar war, control of the wormhole, the arrival of a new enemy from the far side of the galaxy. ENEMY OF MAN is a great opening book, with more going on than a short review has room for. If anything this book wasn't long enough. But there is a sequel, with a third volume on the way.

There IS a map of the villages and I don't see how this book could be written without going back and forth in time. I certainly didn't find it tedious.  Quite the contrary, I couldn't put it down. This kindle version doesn't have the option to find out what percentage of the book has been read/remains so I kept going as I thought I must be nearing the end...and it's now 11 am.

I'll be in NYC in a couple of months and I'll have to visit the Museum of Primitive Art at MOMA. I read this on an iPad but will have it on my iPhone 6+ so will be able to refer to the book while there. This is an exciting prospect. To actually SEE the artifacts that Michael Rockefeller acquired and see his photographs will be a big thrill. I hope his journals will also be on display.

The cover made me think I was getting a book written decades ago yet the book was published in 2014 and Hoffman's trips were in 2012.  It was interesting to see that ""ramen"" is now a major part of their diet.  And the references to John who lives between two villages and works elsewhere for money and has adopted a more modern lifestyle (including satellite TV and watches CNN and BBC)  was fascinating.

Quite poignant was the author's realization that despite the really primitive conditions he felt a sense of kinship and belonging to a community. He talks about how his father left behind his Orthodox Jewish upbringing and Carl and his sister grew up in a small insular household among families with numerous children.

Jen Taylor had been in a horrible accident which costs her everything in her young life.  She ends up living with her brothers best friend Stefan Sellers and his family. She has a crush on Stefan that gets worse as she gets older. At her young age of 21, Stefan puts an engagement on her finger and said they are engaged. All seemed to be going ok, and that her dream is coming true with the man she has always wanted  but then Stefans ex says he is only with her due to her stocks she has. At that, Jen loses hope and I felt so bad for her. There is stock in play- When she turns 30 or when she marries, her stock can then be sold. Jen is devastated and from there the story blossoms on how she decides to take control of her life and how Stefan reels from the loss of the woman he really loves.  The 2nd chance romance is how they deal with the fallout from the betrayal of the ex-girlfriend and the trust issues.
I found Stefan to be very alpha when he dealt with Jen; at first he came off as a jerk but then as the story progressed, I found him to become more human and very protective toward Jen. And Jen, oh she is so sweet and all she has gone thru , my heart hurts for her but she is strong and she can be sassy. I loved the  ending of the story and cannot wait to read the next books in this series for the supporting cast of characters made this very enjoyable.

Overall, this was such a sweet and sometimes steamy book. I loved the fact that the narrator (and author) painted such a wonderful picture. It was very easy to imagine the events unfolding. I loved how thoroughly everything unfolded. There were no areas that had me wondering when such and such took place or why did such and such happen.

The fully fleshed characters and all the events that took place made for some very romantic, and at times sexy, scenes. I could clearly ""see"" the main characters arguing, flirting, and being romantic with each other... As if I were a fly on the wall or watching a movie.

I liked the way the author was progressing her into a relationship with a vanilla character. Nathaniel was so willing to try to understand her kink and she was such a strong, capable woman in the business.
There is violence in the book as it progresses and had many triggers for me. This is an adult read and has insight into the BDSM lifestyle and if that is uncomfortable for the reader they should look elsewhere for there book.

So, let's recap...All the times our protagonists interact:

1 In a bar, briefly.
2. In a hospital ER, where she uses him to escape a bad date, and he drives her home.
3. In a tree, where he rescues her from yet another bad date.
4. On a date, where they don't even make it to dinner.  Have sex instead.
5. A drunken phone call.
6. A picnic, which they leave early to - you guessed it - have sex.

He knows she has been burned, that she is afraid of trusting, that she doesn't want to fall in love.  And yet, after these few encounters, when she runs away because she is spooked by her strong feelings for him (eye roll), he is furious with her for not trusting him.  ""Haven't I earned your trust by now?""

This may be dramatic, heart-wrenching, emotional - but it's also ridiculous!  Of course she doesn't trust him!  Trust takes time.  It takes time together.  It takes seeing each other through the exciting times and the dull.  Sure, don't write him off, but don't go all in, either.  Of course, I also don't think they should be sleeping together just for the fun of it.

And of course, the next time they meet:

7. He hates her, she cries, he doesn't hate her, they're engaged.

Was the book fairly free of grammatical errors, etc.?  Sure.  Were there humorous parts?  I suppose.  I found the repetitively dreary scenes of mother and best friend trying to convince the heroine to try again, well, repetitive and dreary.

I just did not like these characters and I found their relationships and problems very silly.  I would have enjoyed this more if we actually had seen a relationship between the couple grow.

Hilarious, but painful, and I want to reach out and smack Kelsie for not putting her foot down and saying no. Of course, I want to reach out and smack her mother, as well.

Hallees mother left this message that read, This is your mother  I want you to quit your job, and go home and finish writing that book! I agree with her mom. This author is gifted at creating rich, complex characters that jump off the page and into your heart. This author brilliantly weaves in a spiritual thread naturally, along with well-timed humor and fun moments between James and Melody that make you smile. I loved every second I spend reading this novel.

This story literally starts out with a bang that instantly pulls at your heart strings and makes you say WHAT? I didn't see that coming. One of the aspects of the novel I enjoyed was that most of the novel is set in Atlanta, GA where I live. I also liked that the back drop for this story is set up in the music industry. Melody is a famous singer. This author shows Melody and how she prepares for her summer music tour. James had never seen this side of her before. They met four years ago when Melody was in route to go to Seminary and be a worship leader and James was grieving the murder of his wife.

James says this about Melody, She made me forget Angela. She made me feel. For the first time in months. I felt something other than raw pain. That was priceless to me .He believed God brought them together.

Melody is a strong, gift song writer; who is passionate about family, friends and music. She is drawn to James and lets him gently lead her back to a relationship with God. He also helps her face her fear.  She knew all too well that, Fear paralyzed you, made you weak and useless. She hated that.

I liked what this author had to say about love through her characters, True love, sacrificial love, that kind of love grew out of respect, similar interests, mutual goals. Could God, who is himself love, have orchestrated events already with infinite wisdom and infinite knowledge and predestine them to be brought together..? James and Melody wonder. I love how this book isn't preachy but keeps the main thing the main thing.

I highly recommend this novel filled with vivid imagery, believable likeable characters that made me feel as if I were watching a movie! Even though the author gets into the head of the bad guy and gives readers a peek into his sinister plot it never got really graphic. For that I am grateful. I like how the author tells you enough and lets your imagination do the rest.

I liked learning Olivia Kimbrell Presss mission statement, a publisher offering true to life, meaningful fiction from a Christian world view intended to up lift the heart and engage the mind. This is why I read Christian fiction and loved this story.

An extra feature for readers are the well thought out discussion questions sure to liven up your meeting time. This novel is filled with twists, turns and surprises including a Bonus at the end with yummy sounding recipes. The authors says, James invites Melody over his house for their first date. He cooks her a meal consisting of salad, bread, pasta with red sauce. Here you will find recipes to recreate that meal, which is sure to please and certain to enhance your discussion time of friendship and fellowship. The recipe are for Crunchy Chopped Salad with Creamy Dijon Vinaigrette Dressing, Turkey Sausage Spaghetti sauce, Fresh Garlic French Bread and Mascarpone Cheesecake with Vanilla Almond Crust.

This story is GREAT for a book club pick. Hallee Bridgeman is an author to watch. This novel is a must read!

I'm also squicked out by a 30-year-old man chasing after an 18-year-old girl. That one is historically accurate, but I prefer writers who move the heroine's age up and the hero's age down to make it more palatable to modern readers.

The once normal life of Max, Allie and their twin children Milo and Emma is turned topsy-turvy one unexpected day when they are forced to leave the only home that the children have ever known to parts and worlds unknown after a brief explanation of who the parents actually are!  It is a big devastation when the children are left to fend for themselves after a traumatic separation from both their parents! Following the instruction of their father, Milo uses the beacon crystal to summon a friend who takes them to  safety in another world. How the children overcome their own grief, make new friends, realize and acquire their special skills and potential powers forms the content of this fabulous story.
It is extremely well written, easy to follow with well etched characters that soon grow close to the readers. The supernatural part is very absorbing, keeps the interest kindled and makes reading this book a pure pleasure. One has to read the book to understand what I am saying!!

Chris used to be filthy rich (he has two Ferraris) but there are no rich anymore.  Some psychos come into his gated community and loot for food, violently murder the men and boys and take the women to use later.  The leader is particularly disturbed.  They go through the houses one by one.  Chris and his son Michael are in the third house.  Tension builds as the looters go through the first and second house (and their occupants) before finally arriving at Chris house.  The book does not end happily.

After an economic collapse throughout Europe, Chris and his son, Michael are barely surviving in a single room of their once lush and gorgeous mansion home. For a long time, the gates of their luxurious community have kept out the ruthless and vengeful...but with a single crash, their fears have multiplied.

Watching in stealth from a window, Chris witnesses the depravation and wretchedness of a group of men who have decided that those of the one percent must feel and experience the pain and anguish of the common man.

The story moves seamlessly through the current hopelessness and the past history of Chris and his family, when the strife and quarrel of the initial collapse only served to distance them all.

I wanted to see something good happen, but this showed the English upper middle class to be a bunch of sheep.  I doubt that.

1826,5,AJVVTOO9FT2N3,B00DJBJVY8,"I just finished this book, and I feel sick.  I feel sick because I believe this is what would truly happen if a worldwide financial crisis occurred, something we barely avoided in 2008.  Right now, in the US--and apparently in the UK as well--the country is run by the richest of the rich who have bought the media and politicians to get even richer.  As they get more, the rest of us get less and less.  How long until a revolution happens?  It is inevitable.  The only way ""we can get our country back"" is probably through war.  The rich have security and places to run to, but they make up 1% of the population and the rest of us will eventually find them.  The poor and marginalized, who have somehow been blamed for the state of the world, will survive to get revenge.  They fight every day to survive, so when the end comes, they will be far more prepared to fight than the pampered rich.  And they will be ruthless.  Why shouldn't they?  The rich have been nothing but ruthless with the rest of us, taking what little we have for their own and leaving us with breadcrumbs.

This book had extreme violence, which I believe is an accurate portrayal of what would occur in this situation.  Just as the rich got drunk on power, the poor will get drunk on revenge.  There are evil people out there who are currently held back by the veneer of civilization.  When civilization is gone, there will be nothing to stop them.  They will get their revenge and more because there will be no one to stop them--unless people like George, good people in terrible circumstances, stop them.  People like George are the hope for the rest of us.  We will all have to decide what side to take--George's or Dean's.  Is torture and killing justified, as it is by Dean, who was one of the 99% and now sees his chance for power?  There are still good people around, but do good people stand a chance against violence and insanity?  Good people will have to become just as violent to survive.  Will they still be good people?

Will a worldwide financial crisis happen?  As described in the book, when things start to get bad, people in power look out for themselves.  They don't do what's right for the world; they do what is right for them.  Unmitigated greed will eventually lead to this.  How could it not?  People are already dying all around the world because they don't have enough to eat and wars are being fought over resources.

Will this happen?  I hope not.  I would hope people would open their eyes and do the right things before we reach this point, but, somehow, I doubt that.  Hope is represented in the book by Michael.  George let him survive.  He may be damaged beyond repair, but he survived and he is a good person, but will what he experienced change him?  Who knows?  People react differently to horrible circumstances.  If there is to be a future, people like Michael will be the ones to lead us forward.

His own father had a shady past yet he can't forgive her sire for being questionable in behavior? Sabre as the heroine seemed spoiled and entitled. She proclaims to everyone who would listen that she always gets what she wants. Apparently she's not concerned at all with her reputation despite how easy it was in that time for a young woman's future to be completely ruined.

Amelia is a turn vampire, her mother was attacked and she was pregnant with Amelia and her Twin Brother Dorian. They were all turned Vampire by a man they grew up to believe to be their Uncle.
Amelia and Dorian do not know they are Vampires until one day Amelia is hungry and only the taste of the bloody red meat in the fridge can satisfy.
Amelia and Dorian are sat down to be told the truth, Dorian has not shown signs of turning and Amelia is horrified of the monster she has become. She runs away to find her best friend and then attacks her first human victim. She is stopped by a hooded stranger and begs to be killed.

She and her brother were turned when they were very young to save their lives. Now that Amelia is sixteen her hunger for blood cannot be controlled any longer. When shes out with her best friend she almost kills someone. Amelia is very shaken up about this, because she doesnt understand what is happening to her. Now that the truth is out Amelia and her family are moving across town, so that she can learn to control her urges and start over. Will she be able to adjust to her new life?

At school Amelia meets Ty. Hes gorgeous, she feels like she already knows him and he smells delicious. Amelia needs all of her strength not to attack him for his blood. When it turns out that Ty is also interested in her and knows what she is, Amelia has a choice to make. Ty is actually her enemy and its not common to form a relationship with them. When secrets are inevitably coming out will Amelia and Ty be able to stay in love?

Amelia has a lot of trouble coming to terms with the fact that shes a vampire. She just wants to be normal. Even though she does like the positive changes, like enhanced hearing, smell and sight, she finds it difficult to control her bloodlust. Her twin brother has significantly less problems with his new life. Amelia is a typical teenager in a lot of ways, but she also shows that she isn't a pushover. She stands up for herself and is a loyal daughter and sister. Because of the vivid descriptions of Amelia's emotions I could easily imagine how it must feel to suddenly be forced to deal with a new world, one that is so completely different from the world of a normal teenager. Fortunately Amelia isn't alone and I liked it a lot to read about her family and the bond they share. They help each other in every possible way and thats what a family should be like.

What Lies Inside is a story filled with action and suspense. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough, because I wanted to find out what would happen next. J.L.

So there you have it. The full story to date. Now, what do we think of this first book in the Demon Diaries series?  Well, I like Dora. She's smart, smart mouth, alert, observant, vulnerable, kick ass, insecure, lovelorn, wise and immature. She is irreverent in the literal sense, (so be warned if you are sensitive to jokes at the expense of organized religion). She is a kaleidoscope of teen girl emotions, wrapped up in a hard candy coating.

In this opener Dora is searching for a bit of magic in her life. It is a teaser and the series doesn't really take off until the next book, ""Demonic Dora"", when she finds that dark magic she wants so badly, and the adventure really takes off. So, this is more of an establishing project and viewed in that light it is perfectly successful. You get a lot of snappy dialogue, (and every character does get some good lines), but then you also get Dora's commentary on the action, which is usually measured, thoughtful and even a bit deadpan. So you get manic action, backed up by wry observations and reflections, which I found appealing.

Because this is a bit of a ""taster"" it isn't very deep and just sort of zips along. But, you will get the flavor of the series, which explains why it's a freebie, and it's nice to know the series gets even better, sharper and funnier as it progresses. I just thought this was a nice find.",A Fine Series Opener,4,3/1/2016
1852,5,A1OEH7X8M8H0JG,B00DMCV7K0,"This is one of the best books I've read this year...possibly ever. The author does a fantastic job of depicting the life of Sarah Grimke, an early feminist/abolotionist (very well researched) and the fictional character of Hetty Handful, one of the Grimke family slaves. Both are strong complex women who are brought to life so vividly, I could hardly make myself stop reading each night when bedtime rolled around. Sexism, racism, and the horrors of slavery are dealt with in a nuanced and powerful manner. I feel genuine awe at the author's accomplishment with this story. Clearly it is not a light read, but it is excellent, and one I am sure I will revisit in the future.",Stunningly good book,2,6/20/2017
1853,5,A1EBV706Z2AM38,B00DMCV7K0,"This is a carefully researched, historical fiction about two sisters that are real and were abolitionists and feminists.  The story is also about a real, actual, African American slave associated with the sisters.  Most of the details about the slave, ""Handful"" are lost to history.  Sue Monk Kidd wrote a novel about their lives and the people and events with which they were associated.  The novel itself is very good.  At the end of the novel is an author's note in which she detailed what parts of the book were fiction, etc...  I really appreciated that and was glad I waited until the end of the book to read it.  This this book is a combination of excellent fiction and is still very educational.

I read this book on Kindle.  I have, what I refer to as, a ""flawed inner narrator"".  Therefore I often spend extra money and purchase the accompanying audiobook.  I did so in this case and was very glad I did.  The audiobook is really excellent.  The novel is constructed around the first person narration of two females protagonists.  One is a free white lady named Sarah Grimke who is an actual historical figure.  The second lady, as described below, is also a real, actual person, however, lamentably, there is little real historical information about her.

The second lady is an enslaved African American lady named ""Handful"".  According to the author there was such a lady, but very little is known about her.  There are descriptions of ""punishments"" (torture) of various African Americans that can only be described as ghastly.  While the exact story depicted here is fiction, the acts are drawn from actual histories of slavery.  In that context the novel is similar to ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"".

In any event, the Audiobook has two narrators.  They switch back and forth as the novel switches scenes between the two protagonists.  Both narrators are really excellent.  In the novel Miss Grimke has a speech impediment and her narrator represents that in such a way that really moved me, but would have mostly been lost to my own flawed inner narrator.

In the event that a reader enjoys the format of this book, with two female protagonist narrators, I happened to read another book like that, ""Girls Like Us"" by Gail Giles, that I enjoyed very much.  It is a far different story, but the format is the same.  That audiobook was also excellent.

I am somewhat embarrassed to confess that I was unfamiliar with Sarah Monk Kidd.  The reason I read this book was because it was a book club selection.  I am now going to research the author and select another work of hers to read.  Thank You...",Excellent - Five Plus Stars - Audiobook Is Superb,9,6/11/2017
1854,5,A1Z1DOBASN3YZB,B00DMCV7K0,"The story begins in Charleston, South Carolina, in the early 1800's on Sarah Grimke's 11th birthday in which she is given Handful as her very own slave.  Sarah wants no part of this and tries to return Handful but is refused and reprimanded.  The two become friends, not exactly best friends, but they like each other well enough and Sarah teaches Handful to read and write, a crime during that time period.  The novel continues with Sarah narrating one chapter and Handful the next.  Sarah is smart and ambitious but her parents soon make clear she will do nothing but marry well and that is all a woman can expect.

Handful's mother, Charlotte, is a prominent character in this story as well.  She is a very talented seamstress and she makes a story quilt which details the story of what she had learned from her grandmother ""that people in Africa used to be able to fly.""  Charlotte tells Handful that her shoulder blades are all that are left of her wings but one day you will get your wings back.  Charlotte further does little rebellions all the time which get her in trouble and one day she is severely punished for stealing from Mrs. Grimke.

Of course, Sarah Grimke is a well known historical abolitionist who became a Quaker; Handful is made up.  Although much of the novel is the retelling of Sarah's life, a lot of it is fiction as well.  It is so well written though it will pull you in and not let go. I loved both these characters and Charlotte as well.  Of course, it still breaks my heart to read how people were enslaved and how they were treated but this is truly a remarkable book which everyone should read.",A Half Imaginary Flight,10,6/13/2016
1855,4,A359U0JFFZ0Q04,B00DMCV7K0,"As Sue Monk Kidd was finishing work on her last novel, she was searching for an idea for her next project. She knew she wanted to write about two sisters, and she found them when she ran across Sarah and Angelina (Nina) Grimke, two early proponents of abolition and women's rights. They were among the first women to fight for women's suffrage and certainly among the first Southern white aristocrats in favor of freeing the slaves.

But Kidd is a novelist, not a historian. She read about Hettie Handful Grinke who was given to Sarah Grinke as a birthday present. Handful became a lifelong friend in the novel. The real Hettie died shortly after that birthday. Hettie's mother is a major character in the story. Charlotte is the old Mistress's seamstress. She's also working on a quilt that details her history as a slave, and she's the mistress of Denmark Vesey, whom you Civil War fanatics know led a major slave revolt. Hettie stole a bullet mold for Vesey.

Sarah hates slavery, and she finds her salvation in Quakerism, which leads to her move to the North. Her little sister Nina stays behind, but her mother is driving her crazy. Nina is just as strong willed as Sarah, and she refuses to be confirmed in the Southern church, presumably Anglicanism in this case. Sarah raised Nina; Nina sees her as more of a mother than her real one, and she eventually joins Sarah in the North. One of Sarah's major disappointments as a child was being told by her father and favorite brother, Thomas, that she could never become a lawyer, her major ambition at the time. Once she moved to the North, that ambition changed to the Quaker ministry. In the novel she has a suitor, a widower who wants her to drop the ministry ambition and become a mother to his children. She refuses. In real life, it seems Sarah felt the marriage would interfere with her ambition to become a minister. Meanwhile the sisters are raising hell in the Quaker church. The Quaker leaders want them to pull back on the abolition scenario. Nina writes a letter to William Lloyd Garrison's the LIBERATOR which leads to them being asked to leave the church.

But Theodore Weld, a famous abolitionist who had made a pact with John Greenleaf Whittier to never marry until the slaves were emancipated, breaks the pact when he meets the beautiful Nina whom he'd come to compliment on her letter. Nina refuses to let Sarah go and asks her to live with them.
Among the first to take up women's rights, along with abolition of the slaves, the Grimke sisters resisted efforts by Weld, Whittier and others to concentrate on abolition. As early agitators the Grimke sisters were ahead of the Quakers when it came to freedom for the slaves and ahead of many of the early proponents of equal rights for women. They even tried to vote. They deserve more attention in our history books.","The Grimke Sisters, among the first abolitionists and advocates of women's rights.",13,4/13/2016

After just having read the first 3 books of the more complex and well-developed time travelling series by April White (a YA series starting with Marking Time), this one paled in comparison. Perhaps with some distance I would have liked this more.

As it is, it was a light, quick read, with some sexy bits thrown in for fluff.

The main female character, Echo, started out as a naive princess, but during the book she kept coming up with one mystical power after another with no explanation why. The author didn't develop the part or character of her twin sister  enough and towards the end, she was basically forgotten about.

The male character, Varrikk, started out as an sob nasty bad boy alpha male, which I love, but as time passed in the book, which takes place over a short period, he became pw  by Echo and her feminine charms. That was a let down for me and was out of character for him as the book progressed.

The bondage scenes were a real turn on and were well written. If the rest of the book hadn't been so confused with all the various mysticism going on by all the characters, I would have given five stars. But at least there were no dragons, bears, or wolves!

Midway through the flight and above some of Australias densest bushland in Kakadu, their small plane lost altitude and plummeted to the ground. The horrors of the following few hours was shattering. With the help of fellow survivor Mackenzie Steel, Abigail prepared for rescue as best she could. They built a fire so the smoke would be seen above the tree canopy; foraged for items which might be helpful and expected rescue within hours, if not a couple of days. But rescue didn't come

There was a section in the middle of DeadBlood that was a word salad of sentence fragments and ungrammatical nonsense. Sections looked like they had been printed and then scanned back in using OCR -- how else to explain such bizarre typographical errors as ""aruther"" instead of ""another""? LiveBlood seemed to mix multiple manuscript versions. At one point, the main characters split into two groups, one travelling by Jeep and the other by plane. In one chapter, Alex is on the plane. In the next chapter, he's in the Jeep. What?

I almost gave up on the collection in the first couple of chapters. They take place in an emergency room, but bore no similarity to reality of American ERs. I wish I had given up, but I stuck with it. It became like watching a train wreck. So much just doesn't make sense. At one point, the main character, Salista, is at a castle attending a royal banquet wearing a medieval-style formal gown. She's still wearing that gown when she's transported through time to San Francisco. So she's wandering around SF,  doing things like eating in a restaurant, and no one comments on the fact that she's dressed in finery that would put a prom queen to shame?

I'm giving the collection two stars rather than one, because it did have some interesting ideas and, in a perverse way, it kept me reading to the end.

I was surprised how much alcohol abuse occurred.  Some relatively well known actors would show up on sets too intoxicated to properly do their scenes.  Mr. Wayne was a drinker, but was very professional and showed up ready to work.  I found all of this very illuminating.

The whole family was loving and supportive, which was nice.  But there was a lot of silliness about the hero's brother and his wife - both also worked for the WO.

1895,3,A3PIN1MPTAQ4JC,B00DRFQRIO,"In my search for new authors to read, I've discovered genres that don't appeal to me at all, and honed in on those that do. In the romance genre, I've learned I like complex characters, romantic heroes I fall in love with myself, and a heroine with whom I can identify. I love paranormal and fantasy, but I also want a believable world where I can lose myself for a few hours. And I adore an ending that curls my toes and leaves me in tears of joy. Unfortunately, I didn't find any of these in ""The Wedding Trap.""

First, while Alex did heroic things (which I liked), he didn't really grab me. Beyond the physical attraction and adrenaline of the moment  neither of which is the basis for an enduring relationship  I didn't know him well enough to feel what drew Beth to him. And I really couldn't see what he saw in Beth, beyond her willingness to lay him, which under the circumstances, was both inappropriate and unprofessional.

To be truthful, I found the whole premise unbelievable. That's not how the CIA (or any government agency) would handle the situation. Moving into a girl's room? Deliberately putting her in harm's way to catch a criminal? That might work in movies, but I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to really enjoy the story.

On the plus side, I liked how the author wrote the mother. Beth was impulsive, talked too much, and nursed a childish grudge  a grudge I didn't think the mother deserved with how she was written. But by the end of the story, we witnessed enough character growth in Beth to hope she could finally get past all that.

Please don't take my three-star review for a negative review. That's just how the story struck me. Despite its faults, the writing is readable, the editing impeccable, and if you love chick-lit with light character development and plenty of passion (there are two graphic sex scenes), this might be a five-star book to you.

1902,3,A3PIN1MPTAQ4JC,B00DRGTLKY,"This book was free, which is good. I wouldn't have paid money for it. First, the formatting is strange. Sentences are split in the middle of words in places a word couldn't possibly be hyphenated. Second, it reads like one woman's personal record of the practical steps she took to apply Proverbs 31 to her own life. There are also pages and pages of nothing but blank lines, which the author says she put in because she plans on making this book available in print. These are obviously completely useless in a Kindle version and should have been omitted. But really, my main criticism is that I came away with little of use to me because it's so specific to the author. E.g., she recommends you learn to sew, presumably because her study of Proverbs 31 prompted her to learn to sew. She suggests ""she brings her food from afar"" means you should cook a special meal once a week. And her ""husband box"" really had me chuckling. For the author, an unmarried woman, it may have had meaning; but for a married woman, ""her husband lacks nothing of value"" goes far beyond setting aside love trinkets for him.

You may want to download this if it's free, but it may be more useful to read Proverbs 31 for yourself once a day for an entire month. If you're a Spirit-filled believer, the Holy Spirit will show you how He wants to apply it to YOUR life.",May be better as a personal blog,2,3/6/2016

In all honesty, I was tempted to skip a few chapters ahead and read just the exercises themselves, but I am glad that I didnt. The first 5 chapters are informative as to why and when you should do the exercises, how to choose the best ones for you and general information about the brain and the exercises. Although it did get repetitive at times, there was some good information tucked into those chapters. One thing that I found to be especially helpful was learning why certain neurological disorders exist.
I admit, this book wasn't what I expected. I was thinking that the book had activities in it like Sudoku or logic puzzles. However, it is a good read (and a pretty fast read, the book isn't very long). The activities outlined are not difficult and even kinda fun. I actually have done a lot of these with my daughter from the time she was born, and Ill tell you this, she is very smart. Most every exercise can be completed with the things you have on hand, spices from your rack for example.
As for the effectiveness, I would need to update this review in about 30 years to tell you for sure, but I will say that doing these does make your brain work differently. I can actually feel my brain trying to figure out what is going on and how to perform the exercises (weird, right?).

 A wartime veteran, he still suffered episodes related to his military and following services.  1000 YARDS is an introduction to him and his work.
 Sent to North Korea on special assignment, he knew the government would be watching everything he did or said.  He was practically alone against the most ruthless and thorough security service the world had seen since the salad days of the Komitet Gosurdarstvennoy Bezopasnosti.
 While he was traveling under an alias, he also knew that the odds were that they would be able to identify him.  His hope was that he could finish his job before that happened and escape before they caught him.
 1000 YARDS is an almost skeletal telling of this assignment.  It provides minimal description of him, his surroundings, and many of the other characters.  The emphasis is on what he does to try to complete it and what the North Korean government does to try to stop him.
 The same basic plot is used in other John Milton books though they are much more fleshed out.

1925,3,AXSHUZ5PVL8QW,B00DUXS4Z2,"A novel of young love.  But for me, it didn't ring true for a couple of reasons.

First,  I'm about the same age as the Author, and I remember the late sixties and early seventies as a time when you had to hide your homosexuality.  No one accepted it - not your friends, nor your classmates.  If you were identified as being Queer, you became a Pariah, a loner, and beat up by the more macho boys.  Your parents didn't accept it then, they brought you to a Psychiatrist to make you straight.  Other parents made sure that their children stayed away from you.

So you hid your feelings from your friends as well as yourself.  If you were lucky you found a friend, one you picked up as being Gay, but like yourself, so entrenched in your proverbial Closet, that you were both afraid to tell each other.  That was what life was like back then, that was my life, and it was not an acceptable lifestyle to anyone.

If this is a truly autobiographical tale, a romance, and love for two adolescent boys, then I have to say Dan grew up in the most unusual family as well as went to a most unusual school, where they were able to be themselves decades before it was acceptable.  As a story, it's sweet to see two boys become lovers at such a young age.  And the story is loving with sex just mentioned as an afterthought.  For that, I'm very glad that the Author did not get explicit, did not detail the sex between the two main characters,  for if I began reading explicIt paragraphs, I  would've immediately put the book down and reported it to Amazon.

I can see why the Author did not write explicit sex scenes between two younger boys, (because of pornography laws), but I believe the Author could have been more detailed about their discovery of sex, what it felt like to see, to touch, and to kiss for the first time.  I'm sure that could have been written without being explicit, but conveying the feelings and wonders of being with another person.

Do I recommend this novel?  I'm not sure I would.  There are better novels out there, try one called ""The Boy With Yellow Socks"".  That one rang more true then this one.","Sweet, but flawed.",2,9/23/2016

1934,2,ALYI8YM90TPD1,B00DVWRDN6,"Unless you are writing about an alpha male in an MC club, why go out of your way to create a hero who treats women badly?

Niall is a widower living in the west in the 1800's.  He has a young daughter and plans to marry a rich widow who despises the little girl.

Meanwhile, he is openly seeing the town madam/saloon owner with whom he has had a relationship for the past decade.  Even when he was married, he would take this woman out on her birthday.  (Nice for the wife to have to deal with the gossip).  The hero explains that it is okay because it isn't a ""financial"" relationship. So, the madam is in love with him knowing he will never marry her and she isn't even getting paid for her time.

Then, our paragon of virtue seduces a young woman in his care while telling her it is just for one night and doesn't mean anything (other than it will now be harder to find a worthy husband). To make matters worse, the very next day he brings Cruella De Vil to the ranch and forces the heroine to sit and the dinner table to listen to him propose to someone else!

Here are Niall's own words:

""Hed been a b@st@rd from the start, pushing her away every chance he got.""

""The way I treated you that night, in this bedroom, was unforgivable. I know that.""

""I tried pushing you away, ignoring you, flaunting my Sunday suppers in your face to make sure you knew there was someone else.""

Niall plans to propose to the other woman at a dance, but gets insanely when he sees the heroine dancing and talking to other men.  He behaves like a dog marking his territory.

Niall's immaturity shows again when he comes to visit Kate to tell her the truth, but ends up pouting and riding away.  By this time, he has told a number of people that he loves Kate, but hasn't told Kate leaving her in a constant state of confusion.

Add to this a number of mind-blowing coincidences, a plot involving AMNESIA, and an artificial cliffhanger.

Trust me when I say that less is definitely more in the review of this incredible mystery/suspense novel.

  All I will say is that the book opens with a young woman, Naomi, getting ready to consummate her marriage on her wedding night with her handsome and patient husband, Nathan, when she discovers she's forgotten her personal good luck piece - a crucifix necklace she almost never takes off as a sign of her faith and commitment to God to not have sex before marriage.

  She can't bear to share this intimate night with her husband without it so she insists she has to go get it ( later, you learn she left the necklace in a silk pouch before walking down the aisle and this pouch is believed to be in the car still). When she does, Naomi is broadsided and kidnapped without ever having made it to her car. From here it just gets dark and she's left to sort the bits and pieces of her memories of being buried alive and familiar voices making threats that make no sense to her at present which has her waking up chained to a room in an unfamiliar bed in an unfamiliar room with no one to hear her cries for help but the distant and strangely accommodating hooded individual that comes to bring her food and clothes.

  This story is told in both in the present and in retrospect, ""Captive"" marking things that are happening in the present while Naomi remains a prisoner in her unfamiliar settings with ""Liberty"" explaining the series of things leading up to her marriage to Nathan and the subsequent things that led to Naomi's predicament at present.

  To be honest, I did find myself getting annoyed with the slow progression of the story told in the past, but that was only because I was so interested in the things that was happening to Naomi in the present. I did rate the overall pace as steady nevertheless because I found the content relevant to the later parts of the story. The past seemed to harp a lot on the family dysfunction and I found Naomi's family members, particularly her overbearing mother, Camilla, and Naomi's self-centered twin, Annabel, unpleasant to read about. Even with the way things turned out, I feel like neither one of them had any respect for Naomi's right to make choices about her own life.

  But all of this is worth dredging through to get to the climax. Oh my god - the twist in the book was insane! Only the most keen eye would be able to see this one coming. Even if you do think you have this one figured out, you cannot foresee the way this plot unravels. Not in its entirety. This one had me asking ""Who can you trust?"" Trust is earned in both the likeliest and unlikeliest places and by the end of this you will be dying to read the conclusion of this in the next book.

  I don't write reviews all that much anymore because I read so many books at a time that I often feel overwhelmed by reviewing them all. Even with all the good reads out there, I'm hardly tempted to leave a review anymore but this one demanded one. This author is an independent author and like many other authors out there has requested that we show our support by leaving a review.

Would have been better if the timeline didn't keep switching back and forth from current to past and back again numerous times. If you want to do a current scene for the first chapter and then flashback to the beginning, fine but stop there.  When authors do this it makes me think they don't have all the details worked out so they throw in plot points as they come to them and force them in rather than going back and editing. Just my opinion.  I don't care for this method of storytelling mainly because it takes me out of the story while I try to figure out exactly when, in the storyline, the scene is taking place.

1954,4,A1QUQ19QLC2WZB,B00DXXRHIY,"I was unaware of this book and found it when I was searching for a classic by an author of color for a reading challenge.  At 95 pages this is more of a novella than a novel.  It was written in 1927 during the Harlem Renaissance. Given the time period, it is a remarkable book that is still relevant today.

The story is narrated by Irene Redfield, a light-skinned black woman.  She is married to a black physician and they have two sons.  She is living in Harlem with her family but grew up in Chicago.  During a trip home, she meets a childhood friend named Clare Bellew.  Clare is also light-skinned but has decided to go native, living her life as a white woman.  She is married to a wealthy white man who is an overt racist.  He has no idea that his wife and their young daughter are black.  Clare insinuates herself into Irenes life and even comes to New York City for an extended stay.  Irene is both fascinated and repelled by Clare.  The book examines each womans approach to passing for white.  Irene, who is insecure, seems to envy Clares confidence and also resent it.  She also fears that Clare has made a dangerous mistake by lying to her husband about her heritage.  There are several tense moments in the book when Irene has the opportunity to out Clare.  She always chooses to keep her secret.  Irenes internal struggle between being proud of her heritage and protecting her friend is painfully drawn out to a horrible conclusion.

Though the book is short, as are the sentences and paragraphs, it packs a big punch.  You can read this quickly, but the book is better when you savor the words and think about the implications.  To me, the novel is about mixed feelings and blurred lines.  You can feel Irenes ambivalence.  The author does not provide any right answers and the book ends with even more questions.  Some literary critics suggest that there is a lesbian element to the relationship between Irene and Clare.  I wondered about that myself, but that is not a central part of the book in my opinion.  Passing was not a part of my college reading list, but I am so glad that I found it.",Dont pass on this book,10,12/3/2017
1955,3,A2R8CH6HVAMQBA,B00DXXRHIY,"Passing was an interesting book. It followed Irene, an African American woman in the 1920's, and how her life changes when an old friend named Clare comes back into her life.
As the title suggests, the book is about ""passing"" race. In this case, African Americans passing as whites. The characters were certainly intriguing. Clare was unpredictable and a little scary. She didn't really care about anything except her own desires. Irene, on the other hand, believes that she cares about her family, and she does for the most part, although there are some things that she can only see her way.
The book takes place over several years and is written in three parts. The layout almost reminds me of a play, which is an interesting way to lay out a novel. The first part sets up the characters and the idea of ""passing"". The second delves deeper into the issue and establishes who each of the characters are, two years after the first part. The third part is like a finale. Everything spins out of control until it comes crashing down in the end.
Passing deals with issues that we are still dealing with today, no matter how far we think we have come. It is interesting to see how the characters in this book regard racism, and what it actually means (for them at least) to pretend to be someone (something?) they are not.
I didn't necessarily love this book, but it was a very thoughtful story, and I am glad to have read it. I would recommend this to lovers of literature, and anyone who wants a new perspective on racial issues both today and in the past.

1964,4,A1ABKIBBGOMIEK,B00DZVKUQU,"If youve followed my reviews, you should know by now that Im a fan of author C.E. Wilsons work, particularly her tales of size-disparate people. Whether it be the giant world of To Nowhere, or the dystopian tale with a twist The Boy with Words, you know you're in for a well-thought-out story with her. So when the opportunity arose to read a newly revised edition of her novel The Promisein exchange for an honest reviewI didn't hesitate.

I actually read this story a few years ago before I started blogging. I enjoyed it then, and it prompted me to pick up her subsequent books when they were released. After seeing her exceptional work afterwards, particularly with YA plots, I was intrigued to revisit this story, which is an NA (New Adult) urban romantic fantasy. So how does it compare to the story that hooked me on her writing in the first place?

Lets take a look, after I make the promise to be as spoiler-free as possible.

The book opens in a doctors office, with our narrator Lily receiving confirmation of an unbelievable diagnosis: she has been shrinking, and at that appointment, she stands about one foot shorter than her original six-foot height. On that very same day, her live-in boyfriend Erik proposes marriage to hercomplete with an engagement ring that fits her thinned finger.

If you're ever looking for truth in the old adage opposites attract, look to Lily and Erik. They have very different upbringings: he comes from a wealthy and loving family, while she has bounced through foster homes and has learned to fend for herself. She comes tattooed and dreadlocked vs. his clean-cut white-collar status, but they really fit together well as a couple.

The first few chapters of this story are fantastic. Interspersed among them are flashbacks of how Lily and Erik first got together and how Erik discovers Lily had lost the first few inches from her height. The banter between them is fun-loving and genuine, establishing them as a well-functioning couple. For this reason, its easy to root for themto hope that they will overcome the challenge of Lily getting smaller and smaller

With Erik well over six feet tall, and Lily in the mid-four-foot range, they experience stares, whispers, and rude comments from patrons and employees in a clothing store and a diner. During these scenes, I thought about how this book really had the potential to be a parable for fair and respectful treatment no matter your size, shape, appearance, or physical/medical condition. Everyone deserves thatisnt that what it means to be human?

What does it mean to be human? is the provocative tagline for the book. The question weighs heavily on Lily as she shrinks beyond the size of a Barbie doll and feels less and less human. However, I find her humanity shows through more when she is so small. She loves Erik so much and cant expect him to take care of her while shes helplessly small, but worse, she cant bear to watch him go through the sadness of watching her wither away, perhaps to nothing. Thats where the titular promise comes into playwhich I won't reveal because I promised I wouldnt spoil certain things.

Though Lilys characterization grows more complex as she shrinks, the real star of the story is Erik. His dedication to his wife, no matter how small she gets, is incredible and uplifting to read about, and it brought to mind true-life stories of people staying by the side of loved ones with terminal diseases.

Though the ending is heartbreakingly bittersweet in how it touches upon another theme, the circumstances leading to itparticularly with the introduction of a third characterseem a little too convenient given the really deep issues posited by the story. In real life, terminal afflictions such as cancer can strike without warning, and though Lilys shrinking is hopefully not realistic, it striking her randomly has in-world believability. However, this is a story and not real life, and Lilys unique medical condition can be used metaphorically. Does it symbolize that how well people fit together is sometimes temporary? Or does it try to show that true love can overcome such changes? Im not sure.

But hey, Wilson is an extremely talented and imaginative author. There are well-developed and likeable characters, a sweet romance, and a unique plot that clearly made me think about many different real-world issuesso much that I wanted more of that, particularly before Lily shrank all the way to doll-size. But theres so much human insight in this story, so let my FOUR-AND-A-HALF-STAR review of The Promise be a promise that youll enjoy it.",4.5 STARS,2,7/19/2016

I am, even though just on the second book, noticing a trend by this author the story gets way too wordy and drags on in several parts. I am seeing a ton of inner dialog in these books and a note of repetition as far as the main male character having really low self esteem and feeling unworthy of their destine mates. I still like that the ""bad guy"" Nero is wreaking havoc but I don't really see any effort on the pack side to eliminate their enemy. You would think by this point they would be putting together some plans rather than just waiting for Nero to stumble onto their door steps. I am going to start book three and see where it leads, if I still see the same formula as in these first 2 books I will probably leave it at that.",Entertaining but drags on a bit and I see a repetitious formula starting.......,3,3/2/2017
1967,3,A3OAPJ55C9EW1Q,B00E2RX13K,"I came to read NEWTOWN by journalist,  Matthew Lysiak, nearly five years after the December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in Newtown, CT.

Having forgotten some of the details I'd initially heard, this book does a decent job of filling in the blanks. However, it is pretty elementary in its coverage.

Yet, the author is both respectful and inclusive with regard to coverage of the 26 victims. He captures the sweetness and innocence of the children by talking about what mattered most to them: horses, playing with siblings, real cowboy boots, purple balloons, the color pink,  anticipation of Christmas, a favorite teacher, etc. I cried as these precious children and educators were memorialized.

Lysiak also does a good job with the timeline and background information on the shooter, Adam Lanza, and his mother, Nancy (his 27th victim). At least he does in so far as what information was available at time of publication--the first anniversary of the event.

However, if Lysiak would have interviewed the surviving Lanzas, waited for the official findings by the State of CT to be released, etc. a more comprehensive, and therefore, accurate work could have been produced.

For example, there are many details I already know which were not even touched on in the book, i.e. the controversy surrounding death certificates and crime scene photos, lawsuits which were filed afterwards, etc. Even more important in my mind, would have been to address the key issues behind the numerous conspiracy theories which immediately popped up  and continue to plague this case to the present.

It's as if Lysiak purposely distances himself from anything controversial related to the Sandy Hook mass shooting--which isn't like any investigative reporter I've ever come across. Perhaps he does so because small children were involved.

That being said, Lysiak does a good job of laying out various theories about possible underlying factors precipitating Sandy Hook. Discussion is given to parental mismanagement of Adam's autism, unidentified and/or  untreated mental illness, bullying, easy access to guns through parental negligence, and psychopathy.

However, I think it is important to look at the complex issue of parental responsibility.

Although Lysiak is unclear about the concrete steps Nancy took to address Adam's needs beyond school intervention, it would appear from reading this book that she made a decent effort at addressing his growing list of symptomatic behavior as best she could. However, a detailed report by the State of CT's Office of Child Advocacy  following the shooting indicates that Nancy didn't follow up on Adam's psychiatric issues as recommended at various times. In that same vein, she refused to keep him on any psychiatric medication.

Although Lysiak repeats  Nancy's story that she  was exhibiting symptoms of MS, this was later disproven through her medical records. (See Adam Lanza's father, Peter's,  brief story titled THE RECKONING by Andrew Soloman.) During the last eight years of her life, no documentation was found for treatment of any serious illness. This makes one wonder if this mother wasn't starting to become mentally unstable in this situation herself.

Yet, as a single mother of an child with Aspbergers, she had her hands full--especially as he entered puberty and young adulthood. That's a tremendous amount of relentless stress and strain put squarely on the shoulders of one person--even if she didn't work.

In addition, a significant take away from this story is that because parents unconditionally love their children, they can also be incredibly blind and/or minimizing of any abberant behavior or psychopathology, as it occurs slowly over an extended period of time.

For example, Nancy admitted, Adam drew  highly disturbing renderings of murder, torture, and death but she decided to pretend she never saw the drawings so Adam wouldn't errupt. She didn't want him mad at her for being intrusive, instead of being a parent and dealing with the issue irrespective of his response. She didn't recognize the drawings for the red flag they were.

Another example of misreading the signs is that Adam was Anorexic (6 ft., 112 lb.), depressed, highly anxious, frequently emotionally overwrought,  communicating with her solely by email, and  growing increasingly isolated. At the very minimum, he was at risk for suicide. The guns should have been out of the house by that point. Instead she's giving him money for Christmas to buy another one.

So in hindsight, it seems like Nancy was badly in need of skilled,  professional guidance--first and foremost--for herself. Instead of just demanding everyone acquiese to doing things her way, she needed emotional support and the wisdom of autistic and psychiatric professionals with regard to how to better deal with Adam and his growing problems.

Unfortunately, part of her forceful personality included thinking she had all the answers. For example, she unceremoniously pulled Adam out of 7th grade and placed him in a private Catholic school. Then she kept him home for a year. (This information is also in the State of CT's child advocacy report on Sandy Hook).

Afterwards he was placed in regular high school and then yanked out when a teacher advocating for him left the school. This even though Adam was highly engaged in activities and doing well there. Then she placed this young man with sensory issues in a larger, more stressful college environment. There was also a looming threat of moving him out of state in 2012.

All of this perpetual change had to be highly disruptive for an autistic child in general--especially on the heels of years of parental discord and divorce. How much more so for a young man with growing violent tendencies and no way to access what was going on in his head.

Instead of getting the appropriate advice, I venture to say Nancy  ended up paying the price in more ways than one. Sadly so did Adam.

Nonetheless, no matter the contributors, Adam Lanza knew what he was doing--and therefore was of sound mind--and was responsible for his actions. As already noted by the FBI, his planning and execution of the Sandy Hook shootings was meticulous, as is evidenced by 27 murdered victims, including Nancy, and only 2 casualties. Unfortunately, Adam Lanza was sorely underestimated by everyone around him.",3.5 Lysiak Distances Himself From Anything Controversial Related to the Sandy Hook Mass Shooting,8,6/2/2017

I found it interesting that throughout the other books, Ally pushed the most out of everyone else but kept herself withdrawn from everyone when it came to her story.

I was proud of her when she stuck up for herself and ended things with Ren when he wouldn't compromise with her chosen career path. I was equally proud of Ren when he got his head outta his ass and made things right.

1977,3,A30WJKGX1XG19Q,B00E40F64M,"3.5 Stars.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and Rock Chick Revolution was no exception but don't start with this book - start at the beginning!

This book centers around Ally and Ren and the beginning of the book is told through a series of flashbacks that recap a lot of the previous romances in the series.  Ally has a secret romance with Ren and she's also keeping her new business a secret as well.  Although there are reasons for the secrecy I found myself wanting Ally to just stand up and say I'm an adult and I can make my own decisions and this is what I choose earlier than she does in this story.  Ren takes his place as a wonderful Alpha male in a series full of them but his role was a bit too much in the background for my tastes.

Ally's new case puts her in danger so there is a nice action sequence although I wish it would have been a bit longer.  I loved the chemistry between Ally and Ren and enjoyed watching them find their way.  Ally who I've always loved did/made some decisions that I didn't really like in this book and at times was a bit of a brat.  I'm not sure I found the way she talked realistic and I do admit I got tired of hearing the terms ""hot bunch"" and ""rock chicks"" in the book. I also found the way she put herself in the books a bit weird and I didn't really like that.  However, the crazy action, humor and Ally and Ren as a couple made this book work.

The H says he is a dominant, but he doesn't understand women very well, IMO. She makes a joke, he takes it seriously, and then he proceeds to freeze her out as if she doesn't exist. She then stops eating and ends up in the hospital because the H is stupid. If you are a dominant then you know about boundaries and limits.  Apparently he doesn't actually understand the h or he wouldn't have done that to her.

2002,2,A2J8WQHKV75MAS,B00E8ZW9SY,"I got this book for two reasons good price and what sounded like a good story.... Forever ago I was madly in love w/Harlequin Romance and all their various ""Baby Drama"" ( I call them) books,misguided/ misused surrogates ,widows,orphans,steps and of course the ever used one night stand etc. and had my baby "" Ooops""  kinda books.... And That's ok,it's a well used trope because if done right it can be fun, entertaining and very interesting and maybe even heart warming,IF DONE WELL.... That is, not so me woman getting a going willingly but almost blindly into a weekend stand ( lacking almost any and all common sense) then finds herself pregnant and completely cuts the guy out (who seems to be one of the sweetest most understanding guys ever! Period) simply because she's way too huge a coward to face and kind of anger or rejection... BS ! We only get her pov ( which was boring and I hated)  and she spends almost whole book thinking of one lame excuse after to be a coward and never fights for the man she claims to love and never really gets to know  .... Tell Him!! Ppl say,He deserves to know. No ,he doesn't even like kids,she says... How do you know ? They say, aaaaa he hinted at in interviews, she says, ( yeah interviews about women filing false paternity suits against him) or he doesn't Love me,it was only sex,but she doesn't talk to him or try to get to know him or anything, and hold anything he says,or does or doesn't say or do against him... And Jake who's a sweetie boarding on sainthood ( to me) when he finally finds out everything ? Is he angry ? Aaaaa for a few hours,which is nothing compared to what she's pulled and then he can't wait to get married and be w/the woman he loves and his child... I hate ANY BOOK where all the drama and angst  only exist because the MC's can't or won't stop and spend just a few moments having a REAL and Honest conversation especially this type of conflict.... All she had to do was go meet him like he asked to in his note and we'd all been saved needless boring lame drama....

2007,5,A7XO1DM6W3DOS,B00E9YL3HM,"This was an excellent set of books, enough so that I just purchased the package of books 4-7. Robertson has an incredibly engaging writing style. Sometimes it's poetic - one of my favorite quotes from the first book is, ""She gave him a long look, heavy with an emotional calculus he couldn't integrate."" It's always vivid - while I can't vouch for his accuracy in describing the various places where the story unfolds, he writes with an authoritative voice that makes every setting sound plausible.

My only criticism is that the first two books both cover the period from the world-as-normal to a post-apocalyptic wasteland. I understand why Robertson did this, as it covers the period in different places and lets him provide the backstory on different characters. But knowing a lot of what is going to happen made that aspect of the second book a little less interesting.

Far too wordy, and heavily over-descriptive, with long, rambling chunks of info-dump about the characters and their backgrounds to try, mostly unsuccessfuly, to give them some depth. The author appears determined to always use ten words where one would do, resulting in the narrative moving very slowly. This is not at all a fast-moving tale! The characterization is poor, which makes the protaganists themselves uninteresting and I was very soon hoping they would all catch the virus so I didn't have to read any more about them. The overdone and frequently inapt similes and metaphors that dot the narrative just add to the unecessary length of the story and increase its dullness. I lost interest very quickly, so only managed to read half of the first book before I gave up. I strongly advise any potential reader to disregard the four and five star reviews here on Amazon and read a sample before wasting space on your kindle with this story.

The plot is good, different, and the characterizations are outstanding but the over-the-top, excessive detailing of character movement and living in a collapsed world sets the pace at the snail level.  Page after page details daily living and collecting survival items in all three books, and if you read it one time you can skip the next thirty times the author spends two or more pages moving the characters through a couple of city blocks.

2011,1,A1FIRSBLE8NZIF,B00E9YL3HM,"I'm pretty generous with my reviews and ratings, but this book has so many problems right from the start. I picked this trilogy up for free because of the thousands of raving reviews, needless to say, I've already removed it from my devices.

The first problem for me was the MC Walt. When we meet him he's a whiny, prissy sissy crying because his gorgeous girlfriend has left a good bye note. She hasn't given it to him, he's just gone through her dresser to find it. After the plague hits and she dies he becomes bent on killing himself and has determined to die on his journey from New York City to Los Angeles. Why is he making this journey, and on foot? Because his dead girlfriend was an actress and always dreamed of being there. Along the way, without ever being shown how, Walt becomes pretty much an expert marksman.

The second problem with this book is the sheer number of unnecessary words put to paper. Or e-paper. The author simply vomits up needlessly long descriptions of everything and makes sure to throw in simile after simile with his retching.

Third,  It's as if the Author was inspired by Stephen King's epic The Stand and tried to do that but add in some funky crab-like aliens. It didn't work. It didn't work primarily because King's book takes the time to develop a good plot and characters we're drawn to. This book, despite the word count, does neither.

The story is about a travel writer who found her boyfriend in bed with another woman. Very typical story line. To get away from all the heartbreak and pain she takes a job in MARTHA'S VINEYARD, writing about weddings and other happenings. She meets a handsome man (our hero) and their attraction is immediate. Far fetched? I don't think so! It happens! Anyway the embark on a whirlwind romance and end up finding out secrets that could tear them apart. I loved the theme of this story even though it's been done many times. This felt different in several ways. The H is not perfect. Not even close, but he is a great guy! Genuine! The ex boyfriend and the girl he cheated with make an appearance but not a good impression! Seeing them together reminds our h that she got lucky to be out of a bid relationship. Other reviews have mentioned there is a lot of sex in this book. That is true to an extent but it's not really all that graphic. What I liked about to sexual parts of this book is that they were very real. The H did not have a huge, perfect, well you know. He was a little trigger happy during love making mainly because he was in lust/love with the h. The dialogue between the is real, not typical flattery and feathers! I felt like I knew these people and their friends. The extended players in this book are equally great and play important roles.

2017,1,A1S0ZB2OZYAFDO,B00EAHZR5W,"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. It was such a disappointment its only saving grace is that it was free, so I don't feel a twinge of guilt deleting it. There were so many things wrong with it, I hardly know where to begin. I got it as soon as I saw it was set on Marthas Vineyard (part of a group of islands where I live) without checking any reviews. Big Mistake! The author has clearly never set a foot within 1,000 miles of the Cape and Islands. She picked up a few disconnected names and facts about our island, probably via Wikipedia and some tourism sites, then proceeded to weave them together into what she thought was a picture of the island. Boy was she wrong!

The foolishness started as soon as page 3, when she decided November is still a good time to visit the island and the height of wedding season. Yeah, if you're Nanook of the North. Our furnaces are running full-time and winter coats are the norm. Any police officer who saw her wandering around in her sundresses and flip flops would have stopped her for a wellness check, convinced there was something off with her and shed be at risk of dying of exposure. And swimming? The water is always cold and by now, its down into the 50s and even 40s. Anyone who saw her walking into the water would be sure they were watching a suicide attempt and call 911.

The house she rented was in Edgartown, but then she repeatedly WALKED to Linda Jeans Restaurant, which is in Oak Bluffs, a completely different town. It might be walkable by a marathon runner, but its not a walk people take casually and repeatedly, especially in the winter. Then on page 5, she took a taxi from Boston Logan Airport to Woods Hole to catch the ferry, admitting it cost an arm and a leg. Ill say  she could have bought a car for what that would have cost, provided she could get a cabbie to do it. And why bother? If the author had done the tiniest bit of digging shed have learned there are dedicated P&B express busses that will whisk passengers from Logan to the Woods Hole Ferry Terminal.

The worst, most laughable mistake was visiting the tiny Victorian cottages in The Campground of the Marthas Vineyard Campmeeting Association, which she calls The Campsite. She admires all the tulips blooming in flowerbeds and window boxes. In November?!?!? Not a chance! You don't have to do exhaustive research on Marthas Vineyard to know that cant happen. All it takes is a bit of middle school science and geography. In November, the entire northern hemisphere of the PLANET is entering winter and tulips are spring flowers. Nowhere in the entire Northern Hemisphere of said planet will you find a tulip in bloom. Its bad enough she thinks that can happen. But any editor who didn't catch it deserves to be fired.

Now, the writing ::shiver:: The characters are so one-dimensional with exaggerated characteristics it was like reading a teen boys comic book. The florid, over-the-top writing is so bad it isn't hot or sexy or romantic  its just plain bad. Shes impervious to cold, prancing around in her skimpy sundresses and sandals. Hes the Energizer Bunny keeping up his performance non-stop beyond all human capability, using his pole to inject his baby-making juice (Yes, she did say that several times, as a matter of fact). Theyve known each other for less than 2 weeks and shes already pregnant (certainly possible) she realizes it without explanation and he claims hes already noticed a change in her. Wow  a 1-man obstetrics revolution. No symptoms, no tests, he just sees it. Shes apparently some kind of doormat if she put up with the obnoxious ex-boyfriend for 7 years. He comes across as some kind of psycho stalker which apparently the author thinks is sexy and attractive and endearing. Reading this book is like passing a bad accident. You know you should look away and drive on. But for some reason, you just keep staring and watching. Are we subconsciously hoping for even more damage and gore? By continuing to read this book and not putting it down, are we hoping it will eventually get better? Or hoping it will get even worse and wondering what that will look like?

The number of 4- and 5-star reviews stuns me. Did they read the same book? Or were they paid to write glowing reviews? Purply One said it best: It was so awful, I need a new word for awful.

The advocacy against junk food and growing your own food. The specially designed clothes.  The main building is described as restricted to chosen people, much as I understand that Mormon Temples are restricted to Mormons' in good standing.

Hi, my name is Nick and I love to play games and tinker with gadgets. I was piddling with Minecraft for years till I ordered a few books from Jason.

This one is called 70 Top Minecraft Mods Ideas & Ultimate Top, Tricks & Tips To Ace The Game Exposed!

I have just finished two of his eBooks and have had some great jumps, but this one helps me the most.

I waited to read this one last because this is the one I wanted most. I love tips and this will do the trick to take me over the top. I am still a newby but I am getting better with Jasons help.

I love the ten mods that lead you into a strange world.

I do get things at a discount or free for reviewing but my reviews are always honest. In fact I think I gave Jason a 4 star on one of his books, but not this one, this one is really worth it.

Thank you

The main character piloted a submarine through a underwater cave to a cavern, and was surprised to find a vacuum in the cavern. Based on no other sci-fo framework to support this condition, it would to have a vacuum in a space that was opened to the environment, in this case the ocean. The vacuum in the cavern would simply suck in the ocean water, until the pressure was equalized.",Failed Basic Science,3,3/6/2017
2044,4,A112JRLN4F6ZYQ,B00EECLODW,"On the one hand, the story is absolutely wonderful - evocative, compelling, and mesmerizing. The premise is great, although I have some questions about the long-range effects of that premise. The characters are well-developed, even the minor ones. The basic writing style is enjoyable. Following the adventures of Will, the main protagonist, has been an adventure for me as well coupled with significant lack of sleep as I am seemingly forced to keep finding out what happens next. Because of the excellence of the story, I will likely get the next book in the series.

On the other hand, the editing sucks. It is not a matter of typos. There are few of those. However, there is every manner of other types of editing errors. Many times it seems like the author dictated the book, but never read it to make sure the words came out right. So ""clouds"" is used instead of ""crowds"" or ""exaggerating"" instead of ""exacerbating."" It becomes almost a game to identify the correct word. Many sentences seem to have too few or too many words such that the sentences are indecipherable. Then there are the factual errors. Just one example - neither Gen. Grant nor Gen. Lee were at the battle of Gettysburg. The author seems compelled to contract any word structure with ""had"" or ""could"" so that it is sometimes hard to tell which is meant. Worst of all, for me, the author frequently writes as if he hasn't read his own work. There are constant errors of fact regarding things that have happened, which is frustrating and aggravating. There are annoying summaries of things that happened just chapters earlier. All of these editing errors cause the reader to stop her headlong progression to go, ""What? Wait!"" It is almost, almost enough to make me want to stop, but I still need to read the next chapter.

This book and this series could be one of the greats, if a final thorough edit had been done. As it is, the substantive editing errors hold this book (and all the others) back. It was a hard decision whether to give three or four stars. I chose four stars, because I want to recommend the series with the caveat that some teeth gnashing will occur.","A Wonderful, Frustrating Read",14,1/16/2016
2045,2,A19RXNPFGFKDQR,B00EEE52DI,"Ms. Davies is a new author to me.  I read the first book in this series and now, after reading this book, I am sad to say that I find her plotting and character development to be formulaic and rather predictable.  Clearly she has a loyal fan base but I do not understand the 4- and  5-star reviews.

On a positive note, I liked Jamie's character much better than his older brother Niall, who was one of the most detestable heros I have ever met in a book.  But I digress.  Back to why I just couldn't like this book.

This book was chock full of keeping secrets,  failures to communicate, misunderstandings, stupid assumptions with no facts to back them up and lies to each other.  And then it is topped off by a very rushed ending/tying up loose ends, although I did appreciate the epilogue.  All of which is exceedingly frustrating to me.  It feels to me as if the author purposely writes the main characters to be at cross-purposes until the very end.  I hate being drug around like that through an entire book!  To me, it is a very lazy way of writing and it feels very stagnant.  I want more substance, not just page after page of all of the things I listed.  I also cannot stand the characters' incessant internal dialogue either.

Anyway, for what it's worth, I wouldn't recommend this book and I won't be reading anymore of her books.",Last one I will read,4,4/20/2016
2046,4,A10PEXB6XAQ5XF,B00EEIGHDI,"Please note this is the third book in a series  if you haven't read the first two, that's ok as they are pretty much standalones.

Unlike most sequels, I thought this one was a heck of a lot better than the first two books of the series.  I think the author does a good job of giving you a possible scenario of how a computer program could become an artificial intelligence, as well as how a software program could spin out of control as it certainly got me thinking about it well after I completed the book. Without having a spoiler there are a few instances where you want to call ""bull"" on the situations, yet it was very thought-provoking and one of those books I didn't want to put down until I plowed all the way through it. However, the Walter Mitty fantasy-type moments I had while reading the book - and continue to have - certainly outweigh my previous comment.

2047,2,A172OF1UKHCDD9,B00EEIGHDI,"This novel had interesting world building, but it left me unsatisfied. It may be because I didn't start this series from the beginning, hoping this was a standalone story based on reviews, but I got the feeling I was missing out on a lot of information.

This book wasn't for me. The writing didn't click with me and the flow of the novel was a bit clunky in its dialogue and transitions. I found the characters underdeveloped and unrelatable. I did find the concept of an AI developing depression interesting, but it was quickly glossed over and clearly not the focus of the story anyway. Some other reviews remark on the romance as a surprise, because it's basically insta-love/attraction and a tossed in addition to the story. If Hertling had better developed his characters, I may be more forgiving, but I think this story favors speculation on the world itself, soemthing many sci-fi novels do while sacrificing characters (I don't agree with it, but I get it).

Also, I really did not enjoy having the insertions of Japanese, but again, I think I'm missing some background on this world. Either way, I've never been fond of writing that does this because it just makes me think of the obsessed Japanophiles and anime otaku who went just a little bit too far in their expressions of admiration, even if it made everyone around them uncomfortable. I also found it distracting whenever I'd see any content inconsistencies, such as Cat being 19, then 20, then she's ordering tequila (and we know she's in the US), and then she's back to 19. There was also the Sensei Flores that switched to Flores Sensei (which is the correct word order). I guess in this world some Japanese words have become part of the language and Japanese styled food has become the preference, but all I could think about was how unnatural it all felt.","Interesting world, pacing a bit slow",4,12/16/2016

2053,5,A2BPX18O54JBAP,B00EFKOFLQ,"Duchess By Chance: The story is set in 1794. Simple story with no plot but nicely developed relationships and some humor. Strong relationships are the strength of this piece and hold the story together for me. There were beautiful relationships as well as ugly ones.  All were relevant to the story.

The Duke didn't know it, but he fell in love when he heard his Duchess making the stable boy laugh, then refused his, the Duke's, company by mounting her horse and riding off alone.
It is nice how you feel their souls become one in the softness of the moment when he resolved not to take against her will as he held her and put her to bed. It was right then that they unknowingly became one. Before this they were separate searching souls.

I was curious about the maid that the Duchess had brought from her father's home to Stratton Hall.  Not important to the story, she all but disappeared. The initial meeting with the vicar's wife and the adjacent landowner's (the Belmont estate) daughter, who became the Duchess' very good friend, was too long.

The introduction of Lord Huxley brings to focus the problem on which the whole story hinges -- trickery, thievery, and subterfuge of the times; men helping themselves to women with no regard for respect, just ownership. The results of the former brought the Duke and his Duchess together while the latter  cemented their.

I didn't like the courage she suddenly got to kick her father after her father and older brothers kidnapped and beat up the younger brother.  That bit seemed out of place in this story.

Once alone in their home, after the big confrontation between the Duke and Lord Huxley, at the end of the book, The duchess' conversation with her Duke about wanting to be alone was very stupid and off base.  Thank goodness the author caught herself and gave the Duke the proper sensible words to counter this bit of stupidity.

Also the use of formal titles was excessive to the point of annoyance, particularly between people whom the author made love one another.

2055,4,A1HBTW5M7ZZ9PT,B00EFWU91E,"The Mortal Instruments series has taken me from 2011 through 2016 and what a ride it's been! If you've followed my blog for a while, you know the first time I read City of Bones, in 2011, I didn't like it; the second time I attempted to read it I LOVED it and read the series through City of Glass, and then stalled at City of Fallen Angels in 2014.

Hence me trying to read City of Fallen Angels over a period of TWO years and finally completing it in the Summer of 2016. It was then I was finally able to read my hardcover of City of Lost Souls, which I'd bought while reading City of Ashes, thinking there was no way I would abandon the series, and loved it! I then got into the Bane Chronicles, thinking I was supposed to read them before City of Heavenly Fire, but that wasn't the case, so I finally read City of Heavenly Fire.

And, oh my goodness, it's so lovely!

In this book, we finally understand why Clare came out with a second trilogy in the series. If you're like me, you thought a second series was poppycock and a ploy to make money, but after reading all of them and seeing the plot lines play out, I think the second trilogy is 100% necessary.

Let me tell you why.

Clary becomes bearable in City of Lost Souls, but truly finds herself in this book. She's no longer whiny, annoying, and selfish. Jace just became bearable after reading this book. He's no longer on a race to an early death, is learning to love (and be with) Clary, and isn't nearly as arrogant. Simon, who I've loved, starts to get a back bone (kind of) and finds redemption in a way he didn't expect. Isabelle, Jace, and Magnus continue being the awesome people they are, going forth into the world of love and happiness.

When it comes to the plot of this book, it held me the entire time. In fact, the book was so good that I avoided it, reading other books, so I won't read it fast and end the series! I've only done that with Breaking Dawn; yes, this is a big deal. We see, from the first page, Sebastian's grand plans coming to fruition; we see old tensions blowing up; alliances being broken; and grudges being usurped in the name of surviving.

In a word, we see Earth being saved from Sebastian, who's holed up in Edom (read: Hell). The stakes are high, because if they don't Sebastion, the Earth goes to hell (literally). In all, this book was breathtaking and completely engaging. The only thing I'd change is the dragged out ending, but I think we can expect that Cassandra Clare now; it seems to be her thing.

2056,5,A1FEBL7652SEPS,B00EFWU91E,"So I'm giving this a five stars but I will admit that even though I thought it was a five star book I didn't think it was perfect, but the reason I say that is the way some of the characters were dealt with. It was clear that Clare wanted to create the set up for her spin off series The Dark Artifices in this book and I'll fully admit I'm intrigued with the new introduction of characters, specifically that of Emma. The set up is intriguing and I'll definitely be checking that one out. The thing is to make space for these character I kind of felt like other characters got ignored a bit. Or maybe just not dealt with fairly. Like for example Jordan, why build up this relationship between Jordan and Maia in previous books just to have his character be resolved as he was and then Maia reveal her secret. I wasn't super attached to Jordan but I didn't really feel he was dealt with fairly in this book at all. There were a couple of other characters I felt that way about. Also the dynamic, with Maia being separate from the rest of the gang for most of the book. Her plot line was interesting I'll give you that. Watching her grow like she did as a character was amazing, but I also liked her dynamic within their group of friends. And the way Clare tried to splice her back into the group in the final scenes didn't really work for me. I also didn't feel Magnus, Alec, Luke or Jocelyn were given enough ""screen time"" I guess you'd say in this book either. I do like the new characters I really do but I just felt in some ways it came across like a kid with a new toy that wants to play with the new toy forgets his well loved toys and I don't think characters should be treated like that.

The rest of the book, the Jonathan/Sebastian, Clary and Jace plot line was spectacular as was the Simon, Clary Isabel story line. Both were fraught with action and so much emotion and honestly I wish I'd read this sooner than I did. I didn't care for my first reading of book five so while I bought books six I just never got around to reading it until now because I wasn't expecting much. I really strongly wish I hadn't waited so long because the finale of the Mortal Instruments Series was spectacular. There's not a whole lot I can really say about it without gushing and dropping a million spoilers, what I can say though is this book is a must read.","... a five star book I didn't think it was perfect, but the reason I say that is the ...",3,6/24/2016

His character very genuine, supportive, and unwavering.  Personally, I think that everyone needs to find a Matthew in their life - I just loved him!

2068,3,A1AVZU83CYUM6E,B00EGJ3R1U,"This had fewer completely asinine plot holes than the last. I've read all in the series up to Hell's Foundations. Although ""read"" is a bit strong. There is WAY, WAY! too much nattering insignificant detail - just pads the word count (Weber must be paid by the word, or perhaps he is under contract to deliver a manuscript with at least X number of words or pages. I hope he isn't doing it to just annoy his audience.) OTOH, I do find some of the background info interesting, it (*some* of it) gives the action more context, when he writes about leaking valves or getting a cart through the mud, but some of it is just way too much of nothing. I've taken to almost completely ignoring the sections written from the pro-Temple point of view, the book is less painful to progress through that way. But even with that, there's just too much about how many hills are on the left of the road, and whether there's a ditch on the right, how many leaves are on the trees. This is the 7th book of the series, and I'm still with it, so it can't be that bad. OTOH, if it was that good, I would be reading every word. This book is, imho, written a lot better than the last (which I gave one star). It still has one absolutely horrible plot element where a box is allowed to be placed within a couple of yards of a main character without being inspected. It couldn't be any more lame than that. Guard:""Whatcha got there?"" Villian:""Oh, just ignore that large box, obviously it can't be anything dangerous"" Guard: ""OK, you may pass. Be sure to get a front row seat!""  It's utter rubbish. The good part is that is the only BIG hole (there are a couple of other scenes that send the plot in the direction that Weber obviously wanted it to go that made little sense, but that is by far the one that wasn't even plausibly stupid.(note: I've altered the situation slightly, but not significantly, it shouldn't be a spoiler, I hope).)  I recommend skipping any pro-temple section over a couple of paragraphs. You won't miss anything, imho. Or if you want, only read the dialogs in those sections. You also might want to skip the narrative paragraphs which contain no dialog, especially if they start describing the scenery. I got sick of them very quickly. The only other silly plot line was the sudden appearance of a female action hero. Her debut has her at 5'4"" beating the tar out of some 6' 200 lb bully-boy in front of an audience! Yeah, no. Totally ridiculous. I will admit that young readers may accept this nonsense, since they see so much just like it on TV or in the movies now days. But it happens in the book. Is the heroine worried that her cover is blown and she'll be regarded as a demon? Of course not! I mean, Safehold is all about the Equal Rights for Women. In a way, her beating up the thug is disrespectful of the problems that women face in the (real world) workforce. It isn't the obvious difference in physical strength and size that forms the basis of discrimination, it is the discrimination in the actions, opinions and expectations of the woman's co-workers, underlings, and superiors. Women don't ""fix"" that by arm wrestling some guy twice their size. But I digress. Much better than Midst Toil, still isn't up to what he used to be able to write, when he still was trying. Actually, I am amazed how much technical detail he seems to have mastered. Makes me wonder whether he's writing this all himself. My guess is he's had a LOT of help (discussions about firearms, steel making, etc.). Perhaps that explains some of the really weak points. Alzheimers, drug addiction are alternative possibilities. Weber still seems to be unable to create dialogs which are either not sarcastic, jokey, and bluntly honest OR angry and sadistically threatening - its one or the other. Everybody speaks that way, right? You'll also see a continuation of the overuse of pat phrases ""With all due respect, ..."" and ""Forgive me, your Grace/Majesty/Highness"" and about two dozen others and the implausible ""reading of eyes"" wherein character A can intuit exactly how character  B is feeling by looking deeply into his/her eyes. Magic - Just ask HW about looking into Putin's soul...Silly and the count of the times someone's eyes ""speak"" in this series is about 3000% too high. And my last complaint is that without detailed topographical maps, his excessive description of the terrain and troop placements are, to me, totally useless. I've read some good military history which allowed the audience to understand what is happening. If that was Weber's intent (and the only other intention I can think of is to pad the word count), then he's failed, at least with this reader (I consider myself to have above average 3D visualization abilities (and I've tested highly in that), but his descriptions leave me having to ignore entire sections as meaningless blah, blah.). I guess the only other thing I'd mention is that Weber leaves characters behind. A key character (oh, say a spymaster) in one book seems to have zero contributions in following books.  Oh, one more thing: it is IRONIC that supposedly Merlin is teaching Safeholdians about the scientific method and to be curious, and yet there is one character who has inexplicable abilities, and Merlin just ignores her. (You know who I mean if you've read the previous books). ""Oh, her? Yeah, I'm astounded she could do that. What? Am I curious? No, not really. Don't want to be impolite or suspicious (after all, I've looked into her eyes...).","Better than the last, but I still recommend skimming.",2,11/13/2016

I have the complete Wheel of Time, thanks to Brandon Sanderson completing it. And I own thirty four of the books in the ""In Death"" series. But in each of the series I've enjoyed, each book in the series contained a complete story arc and climax. This series has become like one huge book, divided up into six or seven hundred pages released once every twelve or so months. At this rate, I'm guessing it will take 40+ books or more to bring Safeholdian civilization back up to the level necessary for resolution of the war with the Gbaba.

Those scenes were soo messed up!!! I know she was being a abused but it was written like she almost liked it at times even though I know she didn't want it and wasn't in control of her own body but it was sick and weird and confusing and the handling of it almost made me Hate the series!!!

Can't stand for a good story to end so quickly, but I went ahead and tried this one...I loved it! Generally, when reading a story, I like to picture characters as actors that could potentially play the role if it were a movie...I was trying to picture someone for the main character in this story, but all my little brain could come up with was Dexter. I suppose that's pretty cheesy, but it was fun reading this dude as a bad version of Dexter.

2074,5,A81S2CYRRJGHI,B00EI3PP9G,"Review of KUTTER by Jeff Strand

The very best factor in this book is the character evolution. The next best factor is the delightful dogs (yes, all of them, even the meanies).  Those two factors alone would satisfy me. But author Jeff Strand, who thoroughly knows what he's about before he sets to the keyboard, additionally gives us a wonderful story which leavens serious horror with humor, empathy, suspense, and a neat turning-of-tables as the protagonist (initally an unfeeling, almost robotic, individual whose only excitement comes from an odd version of serial killing) is confronted emotionally by a pesky co-worker, a new lady, his found dog's former owner, and physically by two fear-inducing men with mean dogs and a serious agenda.

I would have read this novel just because of the author. I would have read it just because of ""Kutter,"" the Boston Terrier. The gift of character evolution brought the story to an entirely new high level for me. Love it.",Love Dogs? Love Horror/Mystery/Humour? Love KUTTER,4,7/28/2016

As a teacher, I'm always looking for historical books that blend life-at-the-the times with dynamic characterization and multiple plot lines--without too much blatant sex. This book does that, and more. It examines different kinds of love and how circumstances, shared goals, and hard work can soften hearts and change lives. It is easy to step into the time period painted for us: Friendly Indians with still-dangerous factions. We see dug-out canoes contrasted with the ""big"" sailing ships that graced our eastern boundary rivers. Frontier life contrasts with village Puritan life, contrasts with Jamestown coastal life, and we even get a peek at the beginnings of the tobacco slave trade. The underlying theme for each character is ""freedom"" -- and it looks different for each of them. That said, when paired with love and the harsh realities of Colonial American life, freedom is a bit fluid, and therefore reminds us that  we, too, can sometimes find unexpected happiness through the mysterious twists of love.",Through Colonial Womens' Eyes,3,10/26/2016

2087,4,A3NLV8K05ZV219,B00EKVOWQS,"I am not going to bore everyone with a long intro about how I love science fiction. If you have followed my blog long enough, you all know that. What made me agree to review The Dream Sifter is that I thought the blurb was interesting. Interesting because the world wasn't newly settled. Instead, the colony had 600 years to settle on the planet. So the colony wasn't a young one. Also the glimpse into what the society was like fascinated me. I am glad that I did review The Dream Sifter because it turned out to be a fascinating book.

What I liked is that this a matriarchal society. Women ruled the world here, not men. Women were the heads of their Septs (think clans) and they made the decisions. I was excited to read that because I have read few science fiction books where a matriarchal society was portrayed in a good light. Dont get me wrong, there was plenty wrong with this society and the women who run them. Plenty wrong.

I liked Rai but I shared in her confusion over what her past was. The author shared very little information about Rai. Only that she had a tragic miscarriage and became barren because of it. I did think that the author did a great job at slowly revealing Rais strange abilities. Little was revealed in her nightmares also. Now that I have read the book, I can see the key elements revealed in those elements but still. They were very creepy.

The plague was very creepy. You never knew when it was going to crop up or who it was going to affect. The plague was making the women sterile. Also, if it wasn't caught, the people who had the plague turned into being called the Terrors. I thought of the Terrors like wraiths and they were bloodthirsty.

The whole sending girls when they became fertile into the Temple for service was creepy. These were 14, 15-year-old girls and they were expected to pop out babies for the next 3-4 years. Then their Temple service was over. If the girls had issues conceiving, the Temple used fertility drugs to help them along. But those fertility drugs came with a price. The men also had Temple service. In my mind, they were more like studs. Plus, they didn't live at the temple. They got called in. I can understand why the Matriarchs did that. With the population declining, they needed to make sure that the colony survived. Still, that didn't sit right with me.

I wasn't sure about the Guardians either. Well, mainly Graeber. The way he was following Rai around bordered was almost stalkerish. He also seemed to know a lot more about Rai then he let on. Which drove me nuts because I needed to know what his connection was to her.

Ponar was the only one who I actually liked. He made mistakes, sleeping with Rai was a huge one since having sex between Septmates was forbidden. He cared about Rai and wanted to help her find out who she was.

I cant forget Matriarch Bauleel. I didn't know what to make of her at first. She did seem to have Rais best interest at heart. But, as the book went on, it seemed like she knew Rai. It also seemed that she and Graeber were protecting Rai from something or someone. The author did a fantastic job keeping that under wraps too. I was very surprised at who Rai was to Bauleel when it was revealed.

The end of the book was a cliffhanger. I hate cliffhangers and I was pretty upset that the book ended when it did. I kinda wanted to tear my hair out of my head because I had so many questions!!

The Dream Sifter is an engrossing science fiction/fantasy novel that had me reading it until the wee hours in the morning. The plotline was fantastic. The characters were very fleshed out. Other than the cliffhanger ending, I loved this book!!

In the beginning of the book John refers to the lead character Steve as Tom several times. Tom is Steve's brother.  This is as confusing as hell.  Everything is just too pat.  If you like your characters hyper competent, infallible, invulnerable,  etc then this might interest you. I'm a huge John Ringo fan and I hate to criticize him but this isn't his best work",Mixed Feelings,2,12/14/2017
2090,4,A1WUW4WLCNT82Q,B00ELR01M0,"This review is for the entire series.

John Ringo writes some kickass action books, in whatever genre he attempts. His `Empire of Man' is beyond excellent, the `Vorpal Blade' series matches it, the `Posleen Saga' tops the charts...the man can write military sci-fi/action like very few others. His heroes are flawed, some extremely so, but soldier on through complex worlds and intricate plots. To steal a phrase from Somebody Important...he doesn't write the hero you want, but the heroes you need.

That said, he insists on writing women...or trying to. Simply put, the man cannot write a convincing female. I assume he knows a few, but only through extremely rose-tinted glasses and a sheen of...well, not even Renaissance rhetoric. He has two stock female characters: Pointless Penelope and Perfect Patricia. The first is there to help a plot point and thereafter discarded; the second can do no wrong and can do everything right.

The first book started out with a bang and kept accelerating. `Graveyard Sky' is the best of the series by far, as we're introduced to our hero(es), the Smith family. The father a former Australian para with a heavy interest in prepping for the inevitable apocalypse. His wife, Stacey, whom we can refer to as Pointless Penelope, his 15 year old daughter Sophia, who can be referred to as Pointless Penny (since she does get a few decent scenes and attention in 4 large books), and his 13 year old daughter Perfect Patricia...errr, Faith.

In this first book, a zombie plague is released by Bad Guys...who are and will always remain UnSub...and the world goes to a hell where only the strong and prepared with survive. This is the Smith family, and the first book is chock full of action, believable plot-lines, and in short, pretty much everything you want from this sort of book.

Book Two and beyond, though, turns into Perfect Patricia Saves The World. Keep in mind, please, that Perfect Patricia is a 13 y.o. girl. She's not a mutant with superpowers, she didn't arrive from Krypton, she wasn't the result of a super-soldier experiment. If she had been, the entire series would have earned five stars instead of four. Perfect Patricia...err, Faith...or Shewolf as she comes to be known, is a normal 13 y.o. girl, Active, in good physical health, with some decent firearms training courtesy of Dear Old Prepper Dad. Several scenes have badass military hardcases barely escaping a zombie's grip because they're so strong and don't feel pain and will not stop unless you destroy the brain. Somehow, Perfect Patricia manages to destroy literal hordes of them in hand-to-hand combat. She fights for hours and days on end. Now, 13 year-olds, male and female, seem to have a lot of energy, but it's a rollercoaster, almost manic depressive. Their body chemistry changing as puberty has its way with them, lots of energy followed by lots of sleeping and adjustment. Their skeletal structure and everything out from there shifting from Child to Adult. Having a 13 y.o. girl in the middle of these fundamental changes being the baddest zombie killer on the planet? Kinda takes you right out of the believable fictional world you dove into. Perfect Patricia...errr, Faith...does things the most hardcore Delta Force, SEAL, or Spetznatz couldn't even dream about. She is literally unstoppable, and the few `humanizing' attempts Ringo makes last a paragraph and are only ever mentioned in passing (yes, Trixie, I'm talking about you).

That's her downside. The upside is she gets the most attention and the best scenes in the books. If she'd been a 19 or 20 year old martial arts champion or competitive weightlifter or something, I would buy it wholeheartedly and give Ringo two thumbs up and lots of lavish praise. Not to provide spoilers, if you don't move Drowning Pool's `Let The Bodies Hit The Floor' onto your Favorite Playlist, thee may be something wrong with you. That entire portion of the book is beyond amazing, and it focuses almost completely and necessarily on Perfect Patricia...errr, Faith.

Even she's not enough to lose the series a star, though. *That* happens because...Ringo apparently got bored. The first two books are easily 5+ stars. Books 3 and 4, with a few very notably exceptional scenes, drop down to bare 3 stars. They stop being personal, intricate involving scenes and devolve into Big Picture broad strokes as Ringo apparently wanted to get the series done with and move on to something new. Instead of a chapter involving a pitched, desperate battle in NYC or clearing a cruise ship, it becomes: ""We're going to take this base."" Three pages later, they have that base and are moving on to the next base. Three pages later they're consolidating the entire Eastern Seaboard and about to move to free DC. A major plot point involving Shewolf being removed from command is handled in a few pages and with no lasting impact. Another could-be-major plot point involving the Succession Act lasts a chapter and...that's it.

So, for fans of apocalyptic fiction, this probably won't disappoint. The first two books alone are worth the cost of the whole series, and the last two aren't *bad*, they're just nowhere near as powerful as the first two. Ringo got bored and wrapped things up too quickly...there was at *least* one more book there...in the main quartet, I mean, not the add-ons and collaborations that have since been released. I think Ringo recognized this and brought on a couple others to write while he oversees the process. I haven't read them, so can't pass any sort of judgment.

I just hope one or some of them can write believable female badasses. I would give an assortment of stranger's left arms to see a series by John Ringo and...Elizabeth Moon, Patricia Briggs, Seanan McGuire, Kelly Armstrong, Kim Harrison...I would say David Weber for Honor Harrington, but Ringo has worked with him...

Anyway, buy the series and judge for yourself.",More Than Worth The Prcie,3,6/20/2017

Empaths are those individuals who are strong receivers of the emotions and feelings everyone around them has, which can definitely become overwhelming. Image if you will the kind of feelings and emotions you get when someone dear to you has died. Now multiple that by a hundred; no make it by a thousand and youll begin to realize why she considers it to be actually a curse.

Luckily for Jade her parents made sure to keep her as isolated as possible growing up as a child; but at the same time they unfortunately they didn't do anything in preparing her for the time she might leave the nest to go to college. There, she now needs to learn how to set up some sort of protective barrier from the emotions and feeling those around have. Instead of merely feeling other peoples emotions these emotions are ruling her as she becomes their emotions.

Once Jade started going to class the multitude of emotions from her classmates: nervousness, excitement, rage, fear and frustration made her relatively helpless since she hadnt developed any sort of barrier to shield herself. Luckily she was able to gather some classmates to help her gather the knowledge she needed to begin to protect herself.

All is comparatively fine, fine that is until a psychopath, named Ethan, develops a fascination for Jade and the feeling of fear shes constantly emitting because of the lack of control over that emotion. You wind up with a showdown, either Ethan will possess Jade or Jade must use the empathic curse she was born with to overcome him.

In a surprising twist of fate, Lynn and Nathan find themselves with more in common than they expected and the ties between them grow deeper. But can they make the leap to a committed relationship?

I really enjoyed this story! Nathan comes across as a man who deeply regrets his failure to connect with his daughters while they were growing up. His focus on work took all his time and energy and now he's paying the price. But he's changing, spending time with his daughter who still lives with him and trying hard to find the one that left. He is definitely an empathetic character, a man who made mistakes but has learned from them. And in the bedroom? Well, he's definitely a very satisfying lover. The scenes with him and Lynn are very steamy and they are definitely compatible. It's not surprising that after two years they want to increase the frequency of their meetings. Neither has met someone else in the interim, and though they shy away from anything resembling a real relationship, in fact that's where things are leading. Lynn and Nathan start to confide more of their personal lives with each other and this cements their bond. Lynn is a friendly, self made woman. She's happy with her life as it is, though definitely not averse to spending more time with Nathan. Once they are seeing each other routinely it's easy to picture coming out in public - which scares Lynn as her career is in contrast to Nathan's and she fears that her political magazine won't be taken seriously if they are together. The plot has a few twists and turns as the search for Nathan's missing daughter intensifies. and I really liked how everything eventually fell into place and Nathan and Lynn were able to admit to each other their feelings. It's got just the right mix of drama and romance. 4 stars.",Finding all the missing pieces,7,6/30/2016

I have to confess that as an avid fan of nearly everything Adams/Kent releases, this one of my top favorites.  The chemistry between Lynn and Nathan was palpable. The backstory was fulfilling and enriched the readers enjoyment of the story.  The love scenes, frequent and very well written, elicited heat for the reader and made their passion a tangible thing.  I especially enjoyed experiencing Nathans gradual acceptance of his growing need for Lynn as more than just an occasional hook up.  The growth of their relationship was timed exactly right for me.  My only wish was for more story after the reunion with Beth, as the storyline between Nathan and his daughters was engaging and could have been explored more with the addition of Lynn as a new dynamic.

2106,4,A2ZFOF8BYA5RD7,B00EOHJ4FC,"I liked the story, but what made me love this book was the romance within it and how it was developed.  Also the story had elements that I consider essential, for me to enjoy my fantasy read, such as:  the heroine was truly beautiful (without subtle statements detracting from her supposed good looks).  And the hero was not the only one who had a great body, so did she, nor was she scarred during the progression of the story.  And added bonus for me was the fact, that for once it was the hero who felt unworthy of her beauty, I so do not like pathetic heroines, who think they are no good enough for the ""glorious"" hero.  Yes, I know the elements I just listed are trivial, but is what I enjoy reading about, and after all, I am not reviewing ""War and Peace"".

However, I could not possibly give this book 5 Stars (as I would of liked to), because it was missing a resolution, it was missing half of the story.  At the end of ""Echoes of Ancient Dreams"" there is a statement that part 2 of this book, will be coming out in the Summer of 2014.

2108,5,A2QU05H6Y0DPNC,B00EP6TCHC,"I'm so glad I gave Undertow a chance. I read Bloom by the same author last week and didn't enjoy it much. This book was mentioned in the reviews for that book and was recommended, so I gave it whirl. I'm so glad that I did. I absolutely loved it. I loved it so much I reread it after I read it! Five stars of romance for the New Adult genre.

This book was both largely unique and familiar in good ways. We have a typical ""boy from the wrong side of the tracks"" type story here in which Nate, a local townie, grew up on the ocean shores of a wealthy strip of mansions (though the environment is anything but typical). He lives in the carriage house behind the Pierce mansion, where his mother works as the housekeeper. As a child he plays with the children of the mansion owners, namely bonding with Maura, the granddaughter of the Pierce's, as well as some of the boys. He creates enemies too, such as Maura's brother and his friends, who think that Nate is beneath them.

Maura spends her summers with her grandparents from the age of four and forms an attachment for Nate, first as a friend and brother figure, but years later they explore a deeper, sensual love that is cosmic. Some of these parts reminded me of The Notebook - namely her family's inability to accept her romantic love for Nate and her position as a wealthy heiress roughing it during the summer with a poor local. The tension is epic in this book as Nate and Maura largely keep their relationship chaste in order to please her grandfather, a lovely man who is their sole support.

This book contains an exhausting love triangle that takes up the majority of the plot. I love this type of tension when it's well done and I felt it was handled really well in this book. Ethan, her brother's best friend, is bent on marrying Maura and he's actually a realistic match for her. What was entirely unique about this book was the incredible descriptions of the families, the society, the children's activity on the water... I just loved every second of it. I really understood Maura's struggle with her society family and the expectations they had of her. I understood Nate's struggle to step up and be the man that Maura needed, to overcome the stigma of his birth. The past and present flow together here, bringing to life Nate and Maura's entire history and laying the groundwork for the present day romance.

There is so much to this book not mentioned her but I will just say this book has an actual plot beyond the romance and that was refreshing as well. I'm so glad I gave this book a chance and I'll be watching for this author in the future. This was a super special New Adult romance and I'll definitely return to it again and again.

Thrilled to a) discovered it and b) to discovered it soo late where there are 18 books to read and catch up w/ it's like a book lovers dream come true to find not only a series to enjoy but such a l o n g one at that. One you enjoy soo much your already a bit sad knowing you ONLY have 11 more to go ;) at least at this present time... But al, that said ENOUGH!!! ENOUGH!!! ENOUGH PLEASE w/the raping and mind raping etc. PLEASE!!!! rape in a book is hard enough to handle but the is it or you s it not rape ? The F'ing w/her mind just to add another man to her life ?!?!? I'm mean WTF?!?!? 1st the kidnaping and mind rape w/Blue and the almost same but much,much worse w/Anubis and now even worse w/Arach ,seriously !!'
WTF?!?!? And what's worse there's always some BS way they are are almost forgive, I mean Blue is now her friend,now that they are past him forgiving her for not totally trusting him after all the Hell he put her through, ( shrugs,geez) then,then Anubis takes her time literal Hell how his F'ed up sadist version of tough/punishment ""love"", ( not sure where he is in relation to her arm) and then even worse Arach is and Fae my race is dying and the ends justify the means ,O look I love BS!!! And some how No matter what fresh ( I didn't NEED not Want soo many details) Hell Vervain or us as readers are dragged long into to these Bastards are soo how forgiven?!?!, WHAT THE HELL ?!?! I love the fun,interesting and ( mostly) wonderful awesome characters ,but I'm getting Sick and I do mean SICK of these sick twisted things happening to her giving us more detail than needed ( since I don't "" think"" this supposed to be THAT dark or gritty a story )  and then all being either blamed on the victim ( Vervain) or WAY too easily forgiven... V has enough lovers w/Trevor ( who came into her life kinda sideways and kinda took control) ( I mean I adore Trev but he kinda tricked her in love and binding along w/the rest)
( the only ones still w/her that were totally straight forward w/out tricks were Kirill ( 1st and foremost)  and Azarel ( in my opinion) and Odin to a degree but if you've read up until now you know that's just the tiniest bit complicated) honestly I'd just love see
Vervain get the personal life sorted once and for all,finding al way to give them all some sorta ""equal"" measure instead of what I'd call this "" time share"" love she's got going on now ,say them all living together... I mean Trevor gets her the most but is the most insecure ,maybe that's because of how he got her, not dis'ing Trev but the way got her was a lesser version than some of the ""bad"" guys and not at all honorable compared to Odin ( loved her 1st ( as Sabine and sacrificed soo much just to see her again) or Azarel who did the same both waiting 100's of years for the chance to love her again... Or Kirill who sweetly feel in love w/the woman who loved it enough to save him from abuse and mental Hell...

2110,2,A2WRYMOJJ5WICS,B00EPF5LSW,"The Woodlands is a story that had me from the beginning. The writing, alone, drew me in. Lauren Nicolle Taylor is an excellent writer. She has the gift to form sentences that bring scenes to life and to perfectly dictate a character's personality. Unfortunately, for this story, I felt the protagonist's personality got in the way and ruined this read for me.

In the Woodlands, you spend time with a few characters, but you never truly get to know them because Rosa, the protagonist, held very biased opinions of them and she made it known. Many times, she held them to a standard that she was unwilling to live up to herself, and she wanted to hurt the only person who could help her and her 'sister'. And she had no skill or background in what needed to be done to assist her 'sister.' She was judgmental, a brat, and impossible to get along with. In her own mind, she was stronger and better than everyone else (my opinion here), and there was no one in the book that really stood up to her and put her in her place. If I was supposed to feel sorry for Rosa or cheer for her, I never did. I never saw her improve, and even to the very end, I didn't think very much of her.

First person POV does not work well for me in this story. I wished the author would have written it in third person and brought the characters more to life with their personalities, feelings, and backgrounds. Instead, they were the reason for Rosa's eye-rolling. The writing proves the author would have pulled third person POV off successfully, and I would have loved this story more. But Rosa ruined it with her opinions, her attitude, and with all her hypocritical ways.

As a last note on the story, I will say this. If Taylor was after a protagonist full of flaws, she created one. Rosa stayed true to form all the way through.

The formatting was excellent. A little punctuation and grammar errors here and there, but not too bad. The story flowed very well.

2121,2,A3C6M1APVEHL7Y,B00ES2GX3O,"I can't believe so many people like this book.  The plot is fine, although predictable, but there are many books out there like this, so that's not really a problem.  One of the beefs I have with this book is  the author seems to have written what she wanted in each scene, totally ignoring the fact that scenes have to make sense when viewed in sequence.  For example, Lark gets to her bakery at 6 AM to open at 7 AM.  How on Earth is this woman expected to do enough baking in ONE HOUR to have enough product so the cases have at least something in them at opening?  It's ridiculous!  And then her closing time is 8 PM.  Can't see why a bakery would be open until 8 at night, but maybe they do things differently there.  But then Lark has to drive home, jump in bed, and get up again early enough to get to the bakery at 6 AM.  It's pretty much nuts.  And to top it all off, we get to read about her doing office work, and her packing boxes with product, but we never read about her actually baking at all.  This is like an episode of Bonaza, where the Cartwrights were either driving a wagon to town to see Sheriff Coffee, or sitting down to dinner cooked by Hop Sing.  They were supposed to be ranchers, but they never did any ranch work to speak of.

Second problem is silly use of vocabulary.  For example, Lark likes the look of Devon's shoulders.  So she likes the ""girth"" of his shoulders.  No!  She doesn't like the circumference of his shoulders!  No one thinks about the ""circumference"" of someone's shoulders, they look at their width.  You don't have to have the thesaurus open beside you to find a new way to describe something.  This happened quite a bit in the book.

Final problem, and this one drives me crazy, is lip biting, biting the lips, chewing the lips.  Constantly.  I think this is supposed to mean the woman is thinking.  She was even lip biting during a pasta dinner at a restaurant!  How many of you have ever stopped and had a good lip biting session in the middle of dinner?  You can convey a woman is thinking about something without having her chew her face off every few minutes.  Sheesh.  Romance writers use that idea a lot, and it's lazy writing.

I don't read really long books often because I get bored unless its a favorite author.  Bethany Shaw is new to me.

Devon and his 3 siblings and a friend steal away in the night to prevent his younger sister from being a pawn/breeder to some pack their father traded her to.  Now, Devon is technically their step-sibling but he's an alpha and wants to protect them.  They flee to his trusted Uncle Ricks home which he readily accepts them to protect them as well.  Enter Lark who is like a daughter to Rick and she runs a bakery in town.  She knows they are wolves and has been family since she was a kid.  She's very strong and independent and has made the ultimate sacrifice when her parents died and she's taken the role of parent to her little sister Sarah.  She's sweet and a really good person.  Devon's had a lot to deal with in life.  Always treated poorly because he's the step-son.  He was abused and although his mom tried to protect him...she couldn't always.  He doesnt trust easy and although drawn to Lark...he keeps her at arms length and acts like a total jerk to her mostly.  Devon isn't sweet and he doesnt necessarily try to be.  I don't think he knows how...not really.  His character sorta lacked development because I wasn't sure I believed he loved her or not.  He was so against having anything with her it seemed hard to believe he had a change of heart so fast.  Not that he didn't care about her he did.  Just the ""feelings"" part I had trouble buying.  So much sexual tension and glares between those 2.  They don't do much beyond a couple kisses til much later in the book.  This really moved slow until about middle when the attacks started to happen.  Someone beloved meets a horrible end.  Kidnappings and butt kicks happen.  It doesnt end on a cliffhanger but its obvious its an ongoing series into the next book.  I think I would have liked to have more romance between Lark and Devon, but alas this was more around the conflict and didn't focus on them as a couple.  It should have a little because it seemed to abrupt at the end.  Anyways, as a whole book I liked it.  Although I enjoyed the book I don't think it holds my interest enough to continue...I'm still on the fence about it.  I'll tell you though she had me guessing about Daniel til the end and even now I am not sure lol.  Daniel being the actual son to his step-father Emmett.

However, I do find the FMC to be a self-sabotaging low-self-esteem self-doormat-ing fool. She had an outcast mom and a runaway dad, and the only one she can rely on was her brother. There was one guy the FMC wanted, the MMC, but she was so damaged that she ONLY wanted one-night-stands, because she would rather NOT expect any more, for ""all men walk away"", even her brother (who got married). Nobody made her a doormat... She made herself a doormat, and that was just DEPRESSING to read! Fortunately, by the end of the book she finally snapped out of it, but really, it's annoying!

Any way, to recap, Brittany ""Brit"" Ray has an outcast mom and a runaway dad in a sleepy beach town, so she was already seen as ""easy"", ""white trash"", and she believed that happy dreams and ambitions are not for girls like her. But she does have dreams of making it in the fashion industry... and she dreamed of Hunter Covington, a man she can never have. For Hunter is practically Charleston Royalty, rich, but they were friends when young, and they did spend one unforgettable night... but she slipped away before dawn, for she knew she'll be kicked out before then. She did not expect Hunter was back in town, managing his grandpa's ranch, leaving behind his law school, leaving behind his family. He no longer wished to be caged. And seeing Brit made Hunter realized he always had something for Brit, but he also had family obligations that he may not be able to dodge... As their passions ignite, both are doubtful of their ability to sustain their relationship...

The darkest hour was basically Hunter got guilt'ed back to his city mansion and appear at parties, events, meetings, socials, etc. for his family and family business, and when Brit came to visit him and he thought he was protecting her from the boring stuff but she saw it as she's not good enough to appear at such functions, it certainly looked as if the relationship was over. But then Brit suddenly got inspiration that she must create the super-gown that she had designed and attend the party. Just when she finished and got primped up, Hunter arrived in tux and limo...

So, that was pretty much the only words I had at the end of Fueled. When you read it you will understand the Quack thing (which I thought was HILARIOUS btw!). I was not thrilled with Colton in Driven (understand of the year!). K. Bromberg promised me I would like him more if I kept reading the series. She was right, I do like Colton more, but man he does not make it easy to like him!!! You really do get a better understanding of his life growing up and the abuse he endured. It does make you understand why he acts the way he does. However, understanding it and accepting it are two different things. His behavior is immature and frustrating. Yes, he experienced terrible trauma in his childhood. I still wanted him to handle adulthood with a bit more maturity! Needless to say when Rylee was only yelling ""Quack"" at him, I realized that they are both super immature (however, I still think she is hilarious!). Talk about major angst! These two just could not get on the same page for longer than a quick minute. But when they are on the same page? Its hot.

I must say I was a little disappointed with Haddie at times. I felt like she was pushing Rylee to forgive something that she was obviously upset about. I wanted someone to be on Rylee's side and while I understand Haddie's reasons, I wanted her to be a more supportive friend. It just seemed like everyone was telling Rylee she needed to be the bigger person. Yes, she did, but how is that fair to her to always be the one who has to fight for the relationship?!? He should fight for her as hard as she fights for him and that didn't happen (usually).

And the ending?!?! GRRRRR!!! Darn you K. Bromberg! Seriously though, she is the master of the perfectly timed cliffhanger! Its both incredibly frustrating and super amazing.

2128,5,A37R3BNDHBIZTL,B00ESV9MFG,"This was a great book for me. Amy ran her own business in DC covering up scandals, and she was very independent and only relied on herself. This can be good to an extent, but if it stops you from say falling in love then it is not so good. She had a strict rule not to mix business with pleasure. Ethan was a billionaire CEO that she had worked with for a few years.  The funny thing with Ethan is that when she first took him on as a client, he didn't have any scandals. Amy created a bad boy image for him which helped sell his company.  They had a special moment in Chicago that Ethan never forgot. A few years later, Ethan talked Amy into marrying him for a business deal. Amy was so stubborn and felt like her independence was being taken away from her.  They did go to a client of Ethans in Wyoming for Ethan to talk business.  Ethan kept telling Amy to loosen up and enjoy herself.  I sure wasn't crazy about Logan, the son of the man they were meeting with.  He was the type of man to try to get women to fall for him, use them and toss them awayespecially married women.  I was a little upset with Amy that she couldn't see what Logan was doing. Of course I loved Ethan from the beginning.  I could tell he was in love with Amy just by how he acted.  They made such a great pair.

Amys Aunt Vi was a real hoot.  Her parts in the story had me laughing.  I also liked Amys sister, Callie.  Amy more or less raised Callie and was always looking out for her.

There were just a few things that really got me. (I'll try to be vague but there'll probably be a ton of spoilers ahead LOL.) The first thing that bothered me was how easily Jamie seemed to give in. Like she's gone without dating for years, and she's been turning dudes down for years, but then Alex gets a yes in a matter of days? It didn't seem that realistic. And the way that the women threw themselves at Alex was a bit over the top. The last thing that bothered me was the way that Jamie's ex's parents re-enter her life. It was weird and abrupt and very soap opera-y. And then there was no real conflict and it was all over, and there was really not plot value added.

It is dark. It is sexy.  It is compelling. It could easily offend some readers.  It didn't offend me, and it drew me in like few other books have lately. Q is a monster in need of an equal. Tess is a monster in need of an equal.  See where this is going?  I've never read anything by Pepper Winters before, but I certainly will be reading the rest of this series. I hope they are all this compelling..

I have read other reviews now and want to add something to anyone reading MINE.  I said that both of them were monsters - Tess and Q - and they ARE.  They are each other's salvation.  Maybe its because I've seen Dark in my life that I can understand this.  This book is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for someone looking for a mamby-pamby BDSM novel so they an imagine themselves tied to a headboard (and while that can be erotic, this book shows you the dark side).

2136,1,APCO0LXMV8KVH,B00EV9LSJI,"My first Pepper Winters  book. I picked it up because I  like dark and I've heard she's a good writer. Her style isn't bad. The writing itself was decent. BUT...

Clearly the subject matter is offensive and objectionable in any real world situation. Its pretty much horrific. But for the sake of argument, say a kidnapper/buyer treats someone like a human and respects her. That's redeemable.

What this male character does is NEVER okay. Seriously. He's a narcisisstic headcase who gets off on emotionally and physically abusing women.

And her? Tess. Good grief, she's an idiot. Over and over. Her decision making is wishy-washy. Her emotions are completely contradictory and for a woman who is supposedly in college to be an architect or some such, she is dumb. TSTL. 100% I can give examples, but other 1star reviewers have pointed out the big ones. Read those.

Between the heroine's utter idiocy and codepenence (which is creepily romanticized) and the hero's inexcusable sickness, I quit. When she decided that the man she was JUST hating, who just told her how worthless she is and how he wants to hurt her and debase her, was more important than her freedom. Oh no, I hurt his feelings! And she's going to go lie to the cops. Gimme a break. I hope Tess dies at the end. she's earned it.

Finally, it's boring. And that might be the real deal breaker. So repetitive. I hate him, I want him, I'm special, I'm nothing...Good grief. I let people abuse me, then I worship them. I'm brutally raped, but Im cool with it, because this evil man helped me (AFTER he put me in that position and knowingly allowed it). Really? Uh, NO!

Given the glowing reviews, I expected to like this book, I wanted to like it.
I couldn't finish it. I only give 1-star ratings to books I can't finish. And I thought I could. But no. 64% is all I can handle.

64% is when the heroine is to be rescued from an existence of slavery and she is distraught to have hurt her master's feelings... after she just realized that he owned her and could do with her whatever he wanted. The realization comes a bit late but hey denial rules. But he just made her see the truth of it, rescue arrives, and she decides to go and fix it by lying to the police. Heeelllll, no!

And all that after I had bravely soldiered on after the completely incredible scene of the hero making ""love"" to the heroine immediately after she was raped by a couple of brutes and witnessed their untimely violent death. Yeah, to give her good memories. So she can forget the bad memories of the rape. Oh yeah, I also forgot to mention she had already been raped previously. No she didn't enjoy it but she shrugged it off just like that.

Because our tortured hero is just sooo sexy or whatever.

2138,5,A18WCAS5J8SIHE,B00EV9LSJI,"Theme song: ""Demons"" by Imagine Dragons

NB: I waited to read the entire series (Je Suis  Toi withstanding) before reviewing the entire trilogy.)

When Tess is kidnapped on a vacation with her boyfriend she begins her evolution from a quiet, well-mannered lady into a fierce, take-no-prisoners woman. And then she meets Q, and he makes everything within her contradict. All she knows is that Mr. Mercer is dangerous to her sanity, and the sooner she escapes, the better off she'll be ... or so she believes. Tortured by his past, Q struggles more than ever when Tess tests his control and everything's he's kept buried. While she fights with her body and mind, his resolve is shattering. As the first installment of the series, these monsters will have to find each other in the dark.

Book one revolved physicality as volume two is emotion and three mental. Each one tests three major wellness areas, and while these damaged characters tumbled and fumbled, they had to learn their limits and push their barriers. Written in ""dual"" language (English primary + French), Tears of Tess was truly a beauty and the beast type of tale with a helluva intense ((ahem)) steam. Seriously. (This was my first dark romance, so I had no idea what I was getting into. XD BUT, that said, what an introduction into the Romance world!)

Pepper Winters was consistent with her characters--thank you, God! Even as they evolved, their personalities didn't earthquake shift. Her syntax and how she incorporated literary devices/elements is one of the best I've ever seen! Furthermore, this was her debut novel! One might expect that the first isn't the best in terms of pace, syntax, editing, etc., but Winters impressed me straight out of the gate! Between plot and development of the story, Pepper excelled at both! I definitely recommend buying the Monsters in the Dark series set, it'll save you a bunch of ""tax"" money!

This book made me feel so many different things, hope at the beginning, then despair then horror, and finally acceptance.

This book tells the tale of Tess Snow, who had a good life, was just getting ready to finish college, and a wonderful boyfriend who loved her and gave her affection-however their relationship was lacking in a way that Tess, only 20 years old, did not know how to express to her boyfriend Brax without upsetting him. On their second anniversary of living together as a couple, Brax surprises Tess with a trip to Mexico.

Brax is a wonderful boyfriend and he takes care of Tess, and is so excited to go on the trip with Tess, seeing life on the other side of the world as they live in Australia! They go and Tess is so excited when they get to Mexico.

Unfortunately for them both, they go into a rundown place to get a coke, and Brax gets beaten up and Tess is kidnapped and then is forced into a week filled with terror as she and several women have been kidnapped and are going to be sold. Tess learns that she may be terrified but she can't give up.

Will Brax be able to get her back? Will Tess survive? A  week later Tess, after being beaten, drugged and is half starved to death is delivered to her new master!

This book had so much sexual and mental angst, a lot of twists in the plot as we do not know what is going to happen to Tess or her boyfriend for that matter. Tess winds up in France! What kind of man has she been given to, will he continue to half starve her and beat her, or rape her?

Read this book! It is dark, and it is brutal at some points in the story, but it is an adult and dark contemporary romance as well, and it will leave you with a massive book hangover!

I have read all John Heldts Northwest Passage Time Travel stories.  Rather than provide a synopsis on each and every one, Im instead going to simply state my assessment of these novels as a whole and include it as a review on each one of the of the series.

Every story is about traveling into the past and setting the stage for the future.  If you like time-travel, youll love this series.  If I had to pick my favorite, for now I think The Journey would be it, but thats just me.

Every story is a stand-alone novel.  Occasionally there will be a subtle reference to one of the other novels, but that too is sufficiently explained to make it germane to the current story without requiring one to read any of the other stories.

Because every story is stand-alone, they don't have to be read in any order.  However, reading them in the sequence of being written will enable the reader to make most of the connections no matter how subtle they are.  (The Journey is the only one that doesnt appear tie in to the others  unless I missed something.)

What impresses me the most is how the author managed to tell five different stories, yet have them tie together in so many subtle ways.  How was he able to keep track of everything?  And, bless his heart, he doesnt introduce too many characters to keep track of (I hate getting most of the way through a novel only to wonder whos Fred? when he shows up long after being forgotten by myself).

The only negative? comment I might make is that the protagonists exercise wisdom way beyond their age when dealing with others.  And, thats not really a negative, but a wish that I might have shown such wisdom at that age instead of acquiring it the hard way.",Northwest Passage Series,3,2/9/2016
2147,4,A1SLDG8DXDUT4D,B00EXTQVIE,"I'm not a connoisseur of the spy fiction genre, but I liked this.  I also don't know that much about China, but elements of this rang true.  This was definitely a modern take on the spy thriller- I felt like the blurring lines between government and government contractor, and shifting emphasis from weapons to cyber as an end to itself rang true for modern day.

Several of the characters were very well drawn, jumped off the page for me.  Peanut for one.  And the characters and their situations are morally complex.  The author does a good job of bringing out the very human cost to the people caught up in these secret games- those who are innocent, and those who aren't totally innocent but also those who are caught up against their will, and the avarice on the part of those who have a lot to gain and very little to lose from perpetuating the games.

So why not five stars?  It's actually borderline, but I felt like there were a couple of loose ends, characters for whom we don't really get a satisfying resolution.  The professor for example.  The author uses multiple viewpoints selectively throughout the novel allowing us occasionally to see from the point of view of the minor characters, but in at least a couple cases the minor characters just sort of disappear of the map, which would reflect a more the more limited point of view of the main characters, who don't really know the fate of everyone.  Another complaint is that, for all the well-drawn characters, the central character of Mangan is a bit of a cipher.  I didn't really care for him one way or the other, nor does he seem particularly in control of much of anything, more or less clueless and along for the ride.",Modern morally complex spy thriller,4,9/13/2016

2150,5,A39N9SDRMYVJ0F,B00EYPH7XA,"I have read a lot about this concept and how it works for your body. The fasting days are not complete fasts you still get to eat and you can actually choose when to eat. At first hearing 500 calorie allowance for women and 600 for men I was a little nervous but it actually was not bad at all. The first two times I tried it was only hard because I kept thinking about it. I ""wanted"" to eat something but I never was actually hungry not even once. I just wanted to eat out of habit and the more I thought about not being able to eat made me want even more things than I normally would anyway. Then I realized I was NOT hungry and that it was quite easy. You can choose to eat all your calories in one meal or you can even spread it out for breakfast lunch, breakfast and dinner, or lunch and dinner. If you really want to improve results of course choosing healthier meal options would help you meet your goals much quicker and also be healthier for your body but you can still eat the foods you normally eat. For example on days I slit my calories one meal I would have a bowl of cereal and depending how many calories it was I could even possibly have a slice of toast with it. Or I would have peanut butter toast or a sandwich and then a healthy dinner. I use fitnesspal to track my calories so it really helped a lot.
If I had some chicken and rice I could also add a lot of broccoli and cauliflower which would really fill me up and my calories stayed within my limit.
It also teaches you portion control as well and makes you more aware of where your calories are coming from and what meals are more feeling with less calories. There are a lot of studies showing how fasting can really help your body to heal and bring down not only your weight but things like your blood sugar etc. I do not think of it as a fast since I still get to eat and I found meals that work for me that are low in calories but still fill me up and I never feel like I am doing without. There is plenty on my plate and I am not by any means starving. When I first heard of it I was picturing two little sad peas on my empty plate but that is not how it is at all. No one can even tell that I am on a fast day when I am eating because I am STILL eating just choosing better quality meals with little calories and never ever any diet food or diet bars. I really you give it a try and even if you fail you can always do it again tomorrow. There is not a set in stone way to do it or set days you have to stick to. You do what works for you!
I like that this book gives you some quick and easy meal suggestions and recipes too. It really helps and opens your eyes that a fast day does not need to be dreaded and is quite simple to do.

This story moves into complicated situations because of Sebastian's many women. And honestly I think he is oblivious to how they manipulate him even when he is charming them into bed. I don't believe the relationship angle because of Hellana. Overall the is a soap opera drama and you really hAve to take it was a grain of salt. There are many edit and other problems but I kind of just ignored it.,Strong,2,1/14/2017
2153,1,A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,B00EZ7VLDY,"Sebastian Boa is one of those male mains who was seemingly constructed out of the fantasies and wishes of his female author when she tossed all her favorite things in a hat, pulled them out, and decided that somehow made a character.  Hes a wealthy and kinky male model who is also a gifted composer and businessman.  In his spare time he runs a home for abused and homeless minor models and pagent winners (thank God someone finally remembered to think of the beautiful children, the most worthy among us!).

He meets Mariss Red when she and her husband come to one of his sex clubs to fulfill a M/M/F fantasy and he quickly decides that he wants her in his life . . . minus her husband.

Commitment?  No.  For he is the man without rules, as were frequently reminded.  (Did he name himself this?  Its used so much in the book and were never told where it came from, its just so cheesy).

Mariss is super-interested in Sebastian, but also not.  She likes being married.  Shes less interested in her actual husband and his actual feelings than the state of being married.  We know this because she keeps bringing up Sebastians famous unwillingness to commit as a reason why she won't go all the way with him.  Its odd that she chides him for his unwillingness to commit while stepping out on her husband, but okay.  Whatever.  Mariss has deep-seated issues and its unclear if the author understands how deep they really are.  For example, she cant handle being alone and, while her husband is on a business trip, she gets blackout drunk and tries to stab Sebastian with a pair of scissors.  From the tone of the scene and Sebastians reaction, I think the author was going for quirky, but the vibe I got was more like needs immediate institutionalization.  I think readers are supposed to identify with her desire to be with hunky Sebastian while still maintaining the security of life with her rich and famous husband, but its not the sort of thing that really engenders sympathy, you know?

In the way of the romance novel, Sebastian and Mariss are thrown together all the time because Sebastian decides to buy part of her media company.  I never had a clear idea of what, exactly, this company did besides schedule photoshoots of scantily clad men that had to be personally supervised by Mariss.  And it was never clear why Sebastian bought a piece of the company or why he had to be there all the time.  I think this is because the author didn't really know either.  The dialogue for these scenes would have been as coherent if she had just typed Business business business stuff and business.  Anyway, this gives Mariss and Sebastian lots of time to glare at each other, eat together (he loves how daintily she eats a burger because, yes, of course), sleep in beds together, and do all the other businessy stuff that they do.  Mariss version of fidelity is to do everything but PIV with Sebastian, so they basically live together while her husband is traveling for work.  This gives them lots of chances to engage in constant banter (some of it with his cheeky assistant who never fails to remind Sebastian that he, the man without rules, is falling in love) that is utterly intolerable.  I think were supposed to conclude that marriage vows are pretty meaningless when the banter with another man is this good and you both look great standing next to each other in evening wear.

To provide a plot apart from the banter and contrived excuses to spend nights in the same bed, Sebastian has a psycho in his life who doesnt take kindly to how much time hes spending with Mariss.  The book ends on a cliffhanger.

I will add that its really disappointing to see a female author promoting the myth that sex with multiple partners will cause changes to a womans genitals.  The truth is that having frequent sex with one man is as likely to change your body as having frequent with many men  that is, neither one is known to make a woman loose.",Terrible,8,2/2/2016

-At times the author talks down to his readers by making it too elementary. For example, Our focus will be on a verse from the New Testament book called James. James if very practical.
- There was a statement added to encompass people of all faiths that will shock most Christians.

- Also refers to himself as we. Example - Throughout this book we will refer to  (There is just one author)
- Did not use hyphenated words where needed
- There were many missing commas
-Used Isaiah 26:34 as a reference, but Isaiah 25 only has 21 verses. The verse is actually Isaiah 26:3
- Extremely repetitive, especially near the end. Seemed to be just trying to increase the word count and fill up space
- Used of where for was needed and god for God once.
- There were a few run on sentences
- I did not like the Contemporary English Version of the Bible he used. It was too watered down and simple, as if written for a third grader
- On my kindle, the font was huge, and I had to reduce it for this book and then increase the size again for others Im reading
- I disliked the cover. I don't think God points his large finger at people who are flat on their backs

I get this was erotica. I get that this is a romance. I like the elements of using a bond between people to create an army (of sorts) to fight a villain. All of that was good.

The Bad
However, when a book is 90% sex and 10% story, there's something wrong. I felt like half of the sex scenes could have been cut and more story added to explain the elves, the vampires, and the feud between them. I wanted to know more about the Grimoire (or is it vampeen? It kept switching between the two terms, and I'm not even sure which is correct or if both are).

The Review
This was the start of a series, where each book is about a different trinity. It didn't feel complete though. I felt like it needed more of an ending. It needed more depth, more story, more... Just more. Well... Less sex and more... everything else.",I like the elements of using a bond between people,3,2/24/2016

You are bound to make a few enemies in life and the same is to be said for online life. Jesus said to love our enemies but what if all you feel is irritation and distress?

Lynn R. Davis is a very wise soul who gives excellent advice in this book. She explains how if you do the right thing, God will bless you with a peaceful spirit.

By reading this book you will come to the conclusion that having a few enemies in your life may actually help your soul mature spiritually and dealing with your enemies can make you a better person. Anger, hatred, resentment and strife are not what you want to experience all the time. So you have to find ways to fight against all consuming negativity.

Praying for your enemies puts the responsibility for change on a higher authority, God. Animosity and desires to retaliate are not necessary since in the Bible it says God will take care of people who attack you. So this book encourages strength and compassion. Through following the advice in this book you will feel more love and deal with problems with more patience. This does however take practice and you may not always succeed. But each time you do win the battle over negativity you will become a more positive person.

OK to start ""I'm a runner. Not an actual runner, like with shoes and sweat."" that has to be the best opening line to a book ever! I cracked up reading that. This book had me hooked from the start obviously. It's chock full of romance, comedy, sex and great writing. You can't wait to see what will happen next. The two main characters are just absolutely wonderful. I want a Mr. BE! This is going to be another great series by Ms. Nichols. Mr. BE makes some offhanded jokes, that has me worried though, so I can't want to see what will happen in the next two books.

Vixen in Vegas:
So in book 2 we finally learn Mr. BE's real name we also learn about his life. He is still remains to be swoon worthy girls! The comedy ensues as well as the romance and steamy sex. There are also several tear-jerking moments as Mr. BE and Sin learn to navigate life together. Sometimes you have to fight hard for something worth having or at least that's what Sin soon learns. I love that Sin undergoes a major character transformation in this book. She really grows up and learns the true meaning of what love really is. I can't wait to see what Book 3 in this series brings forth. Emma Nichols does not shy from hard topics or controversy, some topics are not for everyone, but I can guarantee, her books are worth reading.

Heaven in Hedonism:
Jolie is selfless. She gave up the nomadic life with her best friend Sin so she would settle down, knowing that if she hadn't, Sin wouldn't have and would have missed her happily ever after. In an essence though she felt obligated, but you will have to read the story to understand that part. Mac is really wonderful and while he has his own faults it only serves to make him believable. Jolie does show great growth throughout the story, which is not an easy feat for an author and should be recognized. I have to say I understand the concept behind the character and why her book was last in the series. Sadly, I think many will not and will slam the author for the choice vs nature issue underlying here. To me obviously the character was never that way, but hod behind it out of fear. I think others will not see it that way. It was a good book though and a good way to wrap the series up.

This is the story of Alysin (Aka Sin) and Ben.  Both of these people are damaged in their own ways and end up drawn to each other. They are both good characters and you find yourself relating to them sometimes. Each book is better than the last. Basically Sin caught her boyfriend with his secretary and left him. She and her best friend Jolie end up moving from place to place because they can work from anywhere. They find themselves on a cruise and in order to avoid a nasty creep Sin pretends that Ben (who she never met who was just walking by) is her husband in order to avoid the creep and he plays along. They then hit it off.  This book continues as they leave the ship and Sin and Jolie go to move from Raleigh to Vegas where they again meet up with the handsome man from the boat. Finally in the third book we come back to Jolie, Ben and their twins who all live in San Francisco. But this story is not about Sin and Ben it is in fact about Jolie and her boss Mac...

So I was looking at this cookbook for some great new ideas and recipes and perhaps even some tricks for making the diet more effective.  Unfortunately I did not think the diet was right on target.  The first recipe, for an omelet, called for egg whites or egg replacments - not quite whole foods, in my opinion.  And snacks on one day was ""flax seeds"".  And on another day, ""chia seeds""  Not a particularly palatable snack - I am thinking I would certainly lose weight if that was my only choice of a snack food (likely I would just cheat).  Another concern from the two week diet plan: the focus on fruit juices instead of on whole fruit. My understanding is that, whenever possible, whole, unadulterated fruits and vegetables were encouraged.  Eat the apple, not the apple juice.

But wine for lunch?  Ok, I will embrace that!  At least on the weekends. And the stuffed chicken recipe looks pretty good.

Double Layer Peppermint Fudge
Candy Cane Brownies
Walnut Snowballs

Snowman Cake Pops - Very cute!

One idea I remembered from childhood. The popcorn garland is a great fun idea for kids. We made them for our Christmas tree as kids. I laughed when I saw the baby sock advent calendar - so adorable. Then the idea to use the decorated oatmeal canisters for gift giving was something I thought I'd thought up. It has worked well for shipping cupcakes in the past.

Other projects like making paper snowflakes will keep kids busy during the holiday season. There are also lots of ideas for how to incorporate pictures into ornaments. The ideas for the tree ornaments and other decorations will give you an excuse to go to the craft store for glue, glitter and paint.

So some of these ideas brought back fond memories from my childhood, especially memories of my grandmother's house. I read this book while inhaling the scent of fir needle essential oil in my diffuser. It was a fun experience just to read the book and I'm going to have fun making the peppermint fudge this year.

Only caution I'd really give is don't make the eggnog recipe - raw eggs! And be careful with some decorations with strings on them around cats and dogs.

2183,2,A1ODI3DRI04JZO,B00F4A6S3Y,"When I saw this friends to lovers story by Jane Harvey-Berrick, I was so excited. I've loved several of her other books and I love that kind of story line so I dove right in. From the get-go I knew I was going to have trouble with this one but every time I put it down, I had to start up again because I needed to know how Miles and Clare finally got to the lovers point of their relationship. But when they finally did, it was a bit of a let down.

Miles and Clare have been friends forever. Miles is the gorgeous, actor friend who doesn't see himself clearly and has always struggled in school. He continues to fall in love with his leading ladies, but is always left out in the cold when the relationship doesn't work out. Clare has followed Miles around for years. She's the plain jane, girl next door who's always been there for her best friend, yet Miles is oblivious to her desire for more. When he lands his big break as a leading character in a movie overseas, he becomes famous overnight. He then eventually, once again, falls for his leading lady. His obliviousness takes over and with his new found fame, he just wants Clare there to help the transition. But when Miles never chooses Clare first even as friends, she finally gives up making Miles realizes what he's doing.

To be honest both Clare and Miles irritated me. Miles because he was so freaking clueless and Clare because her inner monologue was kind of obnoxious. It took forever for them to become the lovers part of the story and then it happened like flipping a light switch. It wasn't there then all the sudden it was. I just didn't feel it. I didn't feel their connection. The ending wrapped up so quickly, too, that it made me get a bit of whiplash.

2187,5,AY7GNV7R2OGJX,B00F64A1YK,"This book amazed me!
Read the reviews - Many are far better than my short script below!

One of the reviewers said the same thing that I'm feeling - ""I am having trouble organizing my thoughts enough to tell you how great of a read this was. It's so much more than romance. It's Faith, the Human condition, Prejudice, Racism, Fear, Loss, Survival, Psychosis, Perseverance, Love and way more.""

I loved and hated the beginning. Although it was far from boring; I was very impatient with the 'introduction' chapters of each of our main characters. I was thinking to myself  ' Yeah - This is interesting but let's just get to the story already!' However - that being said - I have to admit that as I read more of the story I realized that the introduction of the characters was extremely crucial!  It brought a better understanding of why the characters did what they did and why they acted as they did.

Plot - Excellent! This is a Sci-fi romance. Some may even say it's a dark romance as there are scenes of rape and horrific deaths. These scenes are hard to read but I felt that the author included them to portray the brutal culture in that alien world. The scenes elicited feelings of horror and disgust in the reader - and brought us closer to a better understanding of what the characters were feeling and experiencing.  I laughed with them and cried for them!

Characters - Excellent.  They are individual and diverse. Highly developed and complex with their own characteristics and quirks [and languages]. They have depth and as a reader you really begin to care about them.

World Building - Awesome! The attention to detail without being repetitive and boring is perfect.

This book was impossible to put down. The story pulled you in deep and stayed with you even after you finished it!

Will I read this again? Absolutely! It was THAT Good!

Will I buy more from this [new to me] author? Yes!",Amazing Sci-fi Romance! Truth! ;),5,10/10/2017

She was straight forward; calls a spade a spade and takes no bulls**t from anyone. Was a bit confusing when the Dumaqs are introduced but only because of the way it's written, as though the reader had met them before. Apart from a few grammatical errors and words either in the wrong place or missing, I could not get the book out of my head. Whenever I was not reading it, I could not wait to get back to it. It is so realistic in its portrayal of survivors from a crash, their way of projecting themselves as victims, turning into sheep following the loudest in the herd.

It may be over a thousand pages in length but I loved every word of it. After crash landing on an alien planet 48 human survivors are all that is left from a ship carrying 20,000 people to start a community on an Earth like planet. Amber is the only one of those people with any sense. Everyone else blindly follows Scott, the self appointed Commander of the group because he is the highest ranking crew member left among the survivors. And by highest ranking I mean he was a glorified usher. His decisions are stupid and yet Amber is the person that everyone hates because she questions his leadership. Meoraq was amazing. I never thought that I would fall in love with a human-like, alien lizard. He's a warrior on a holy quest that believes that Sheul has placed these humans in is path as a trial. I wanted to slap those ""insufferable humans"" in the face just as much as he did. This story is dark, brutal, and violent and definitely not for sensitive readers.

Meoraq and Amber were amazing characters to read about. They both grew and learned both as individuals and then with each other. It was such a beautiful and amazing story about survival, love, endurance, courage, and a person's own beliefs about God or a lack thereof. It made me question things and think about God in a new way. It made look at blind faith in a different light. Amber is this take-no-shit character and watching her and Meoraq interact and grow slowly in love was absolutely amazing.

The authors name did hold me back from reading the stories at first. I have had the authors books for years.

This is a story with characters you feel invested in. Also characters from this story are found in others so there is a connection. I like the base of the story and how the title really was apart of the story. I was over joyed by the connections even if they may be unrealistic. I wanted to believe so that is all that matters.
 I loved both lead characters. I liked most except the ex-husband. He made a nice villain. I even liked the wife he married after.

You will leave this story with a clear resolution. There is a HEA ending. No cliffhangers. There is even an epilogue to quench you need to what happened after. There is plenty of sex but it fits the story. It even played out as an interesting lesson when the MFC was learning. It felt like you left with a bit of an education.

2208,3,A28M1742TGQX12,B00F8Q1RIU,"This is a fascinating title, my nephew and grandson are into ""magic"" tricks so I thought this would be fun and instructive. Chapter one explains ""Mental Magic"", making others believe it is magic. The author, Jason Scotts, notes you can go online and learn tricks. Chapter two talks about the rules of  ""Magic the gathering card game but unless you already have the cards and know the vocabulary, it is quite confusing. Chapter three  is titled ""how to become a mental magician "" and lists a number of tricks (sorry, I did not count them) but is irrelevant as directions for many are not clear. here are directions for one called ""coin in balloon""  another trick is where the magician has a previously bent coin in his pocket and asks an audience member for a coin, switches the coins with slight of hand (no detail on how to switch) and convince audience the coin was bent by mental powers.

""What you need in order to perform this trick is a balloon, a coin, a bottle, and a straw. You take the coin and place it inside the balloon. Take the straw and stretch out the balloon with the coin in it, creating a small hole for the coin to go into on the top of the cup.""

That's it, no more direction on the cup when or how you get the coin through the hole. Some of the card tricks are more complete and would be doable with practice. He notes a magician needs keen powers of observation and may be able to identify a birth month by birthstone jewelry and to watch  reactions as you talk, is there interest or reaction to a guess you make? Then you can eliminate possibilities.

There are some card and coin tricks with enough description to be able to follow but overall I do not recommend this book as there is much lack of clarity, turns out it was not so much fun and not so instructive. So much for my expectations. You may find it otherwise but I found it disappointing. If you just want a light read for passing the time or learning that magic is illusion, it is fine.

This is a short book, written in a friendly format, easy to read, easy to understand. This book contains concepts and references about what is a Mental Magic Trick, The Rules of Mental Magic, How to Become a Mental Magician and how mental cards, coins or table magic tricks work. You can read about the mental tricks six categories: foreknowledge, mind control, memory feats, extrasensory perception, prophecy and premonition. According to the author, one of the most important components of a mental trick is the performance style. A good Mentalist Magician is very good at reading others (body language) and knows that the brain uses the bodys ears and eyes to help produce images and he will use this knowledge to make the magic more believable. On chapter 4th you will read about mental card tricks as the author has included several tricks and how you can perform tricks like Mind Reader, Four jacks, Finders Keepers, Impulsable, Flip the Script, Card Never Changes and some more. On Chapter 5th, the author will show you 10 mental coin tricks and how do they work. And, on the final chapter you will read about 10 table magic tricks and how do they work.

A person doesn't leave without a word and stay gone for 10 years without any contact then just pop up with no warning if they have the slightest bit of care for that person.  The author constantly wrote about how the new Jake was so cocky and confident but where was his remorse and guilt?

The author also portrayed Eve as a strong person, but if this was so, I believe she would have moved on from this unhealthy obsession years ago.  And she definitely wouldn't have accepted him back into her life so easily.  In addition,  I found it hard to believe that her so called ""friend"", Jennie, was playing matchmaker  especially as a psychologist.  Anyone should know if it was in him to treat her so badly for the last 10 years, then it would be in him to do it again.  Furthermore, a therapist would not have interfered in Eve's life once Jake was back but let Eve figure that out on her own.  As a psychologist and friend, Jennie would have referred Eve for therapy years ago to help her get over Jake and move on with a healthier life.  As far as all the sex Eve was having with Jake, how could she be intimate and vulnerable (which sex is unless it is ""just sex"") with a man who treated her so badly?  Where was the self respect of a supposedly strong woman?  Forgive is one thing; forget is another.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least the author was respectful to her characters.  These are all likeable though flawed characters, even Jake.  She didn't have the males calling the females by degrading and misogynistic names especially during sex as happens so often in the romantic erotica these days.

I fell in love with our H in book 1 and he kept endearing himself to me as the series progressed.  Yes, this can be a stand alone, but I really hate for a reader to miss the beginning of their stories and how each brother found love.  Neither journey to HEA was smooth either.

Thankfully this didn't have a kidnapping scene as did books 1 and 2.  The reason I didn't care for book 2 as much as the others is the scenes in book 2 were very similar to book 1.

This was a unique story and I enjoyed it all the way through.  Our H was a very honorable man and that caused him many stressful moments.  There is suspense, almost rape so be warned, romance that builds slowly, passionate lovemaking within marriage and only described once.

This is a wonderful story, of two souls would try and mesh as one with a lot happening in between.  I highly recommend this story and the whole series.  If you love Highland Romance and some battle scenes, this series is for you.  (ljb)",MY FAVORITE OF THE TRILOGY!,3,8/20/2016

This is a sweet and endearing story of second chances. Mason returns to his hometown to make amends and convince the love of his life that he is a changed and better man. He left Lark confused and heartbroken the day after he proposed to her. Lark has picked up the pieces of her battered heart and moved on with her life. But when Mason shows up unexpectedly, asking for 7 dates to prove he will do whatever it takes to show her he has never stopped loving her, Lark wants nothing to do with him. I liked how Lark did not give in easily and even wanted to plan a date of her own. Lark's sister's were also very protective of her and made it clear to Mason he was not welcome. So set the stage for proving he was truly repentant. I liked Mason even if I didn't agree with his past decisions. He demonstrated he was humble and would take the chiding he deserved to prove he had grown and matured and would never hurt the one person who truly loved him, so horribly again. Lark challenged Mason and their chemistry was still as fiery as ever. This is a charming and heartwarming story that sets up the town and the characters for future story lines perfectly.

There were a few things that I think the author could have played up more, such as Lauren's having to work with Nate's mother over the last fifteen years and how difficult that must have been for her.  She never really had a chance to get over him with constant reminders.  I think that would have added a nice layer to the story.  Also, the author could have delved a little more into the emotions involved on both Nate's and Lauren's sides; it should've been a little harder to get past all of the time wasted between the two and while the author mentions it repeatedly, I think she could've done a better job at making the reader feel what that was like.  It seemed a bit implausible that Nate would land back in town fifteen years later and actually think he'd have a chance!  Fifteen years later!  Then, of course, he did have a chance, but it just didn't ring true.  I was half expecting him to show up at the fundraiser at the end of the book when Kevin confronts Lauren to give her another chance ~ might have been interesting to see him get jealous, thinking Lauren was possibly going back to Kevin after cancelling the engagement.

They are pretty close friends who take it to heart when the other isn't feeling up to par. Now, Abby has her own doubts and fears and she carries them around with her daily. One thing I really enjoyed with the girls is that they each encourage the other to feel their best each day by leaving notes on the mirror in the bathroom.
One day, Courtney leaves a little dare for Abby to step out of her comfort zone to meet a guy. So while she's out walking her dog, she runs into Seth who just happens to be walking his dog. He seems to be quite out-doorsy and very unattached. The two really seem to hit it off and one afternoon doggy date turns into a second date out to dinner. By that night, Abby wants to shed the weight that's been holding her back from moving forward with her life. One thing leads to another, and Seth starts inviting Abby to his family functions.

And while she's out one night, she lands into Sam's arms. Learning some things about the man, Abby finds out that he's a real-as-they-come man underneath the complexities.

That said, I love the two main male characters (Seth and Sam) and Abby's friends. The story was very fast moving and made me interested in the secondary characters lives.

Brock Gamble's life is in the ultimate tailspin after his wife and children's abduction.  Though he ultimately got them back and they were safe, the lies and deceit he had to construe  have left him alone. Bad decision after bad decision led him to ultimately betray his family as well as his trusted team at the Titan Group.

In a last ditch effort to win his wife back, he persuades her to take an exotic vacation.  His only hope is to reclaim his marriage.  But when duty calls and he is the only one who can help, he must make a pivotal decision.

I love that there was a follow up to Brock's  story after his ultimate deceit.  I can't wait to read more from this amazing series!

The plot is almost interesting enough to make me finish the book.  The characters are annoying and unbelievable enough to make me not.  The male protagonist is ""man"" enough to go around shooting at people, but in reality possesses the maturity of 13 year old boy.  He would rather throw the woman he supposedly loves under the bus, lie to her and refuse to leave a job where he is told he must put his job ahead of his woman.  The female protagonist is supposedly bad-ass enough to run her own search and rescue group and doesn't balk at slithering around in the snow and muck to rescue someone, and yet is sexually inexperienced enough to have never had sex in anything other than the missionary position.

2265,3,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B00FFH1QEW,"As its name suggests, Dan Ames's ""Death by Sarcasm"" reads like a cross between a hardboiled PI novel and a standup comedy routine. If author Ames is thinking about getting into comedy, he should stick to his day job, because, as a mystery, ""Sarcasm"" is rather good, if far fetched. As a series of one-liners, however, this material would get hooted off the stage on Open Mike night at one of the numerous comedy clubs Ames describes in the book.

The heroine of ""Death by Sarcasm,"" Mary Cornell, is a fan of the caustic putdown, and she comes by it naturally. Her uncle Brent is, or more precisely, was, a successful comic whose body was found outside a low-end comedy club after being murdered in a rather gruesome manner. Mary decides to investigate the murder, which involves her going to various seedy clubs and getting in snide remark duels with everyone she meets and antagonizing nearly every other character in the book. Not surprisingly, the body count rises steadily as the book goes on, with Mary herself the target of the killer.

Theres actually a pretty good mystery at the heart of Death by Sarcasm, and when Mary takes time out from her sarcastic replies to investigate the case, the book is rather interesting. As in a lot of detective stories, the key to the mystery is buried years in the past, when Uncle Brent was a struggling young comic who hung out in the same house with some of the other characters in the book. Now, in addition to Brent, some of his former housemates start turning up dead, and Mary tries to track the rest down to either find the killer or prevent more killings. The sections where Mary investigates and tries to get people to reveal what happened decades earlier are by far the best in the book, showcasing Amess writing skills.

Those skills do not, however, extend to the many comedy routines in the book. Mary is the sort of character who doesnt feel comfortable unless shes cutting down whoever shes talking to in almost every single sentence. Imagine spending 200 pages with a considerably more attractive version of Don Rickles and you get the idea. If Death by Sarcasm were a reality-based book, in which readers were given the impression that the characters were operating in the real world, this would be a fatal flaw. As it was, I kept wondering at times how Mary thought that she would get any information or assistance from anyone who had just been used as her punching bag for an entire chapter. But author Ames puts enough totally bizarre scenes in the book (elderly women serving as a harem for one character; senior citizens dressing in Richard Nixon masks as they pull off a crime) that readers know to take what they are reading with a grain of salt.

The biggest flaw with Death by Sarcasm is that the book and the lead character are seldom as funny as the author thinks they are. The ratio of funny to non-funny jokes is, at best 1 in 5. And, I realize that humor is very subjective, but too many of Marys putdowns struck me as simply dumb, and the accumulated weight of them left me with the same feeling I sometimes get in a comedy club with a bad headliner looking for the exit.

I liked enough about Death by Sarcasm to give it a marginal, three-star rating (much closer to 2.5 stars, which I would have given it if I could). The central storyline is quite good (although its serious nature clashes with a lot of silliness in the book), and the material about the comedy clubs and performers felt authentic and interesting enough to keep me involved. But, if author Ames wants to continue writing books with Mary Cornell as his main character, he needs to get some better jokes, or readers are likely to give him the hook.",Take the Story; Leave the Jokes,2,8/14/2016

I had to skim over too many parts of the book to make it a book I could love. The plot is great, good writing, likable characters, a nice historical note at the end of the story--i.e. it was a great book, just too much sex. IMHO, if a book can't stand on it's own without requiring titillation to attract readers, it is a failure; and this story would have succeeded without all the sex.

2284,5,A3PBD5LUY1F529,B00FJNPJMW,"SONATA FOR A SCOUNDREL has been on my kindle for 18 months, and I'm so glad I finally read it. I'm stunned (in a very good way) with the magical turns of phrase employed by the author. In a visual form of entertainment (printed books) it's amazing she could make me *hear* the music, and so much more than simply the movement of the performers at the keyboard or violin. I heard the passion within the musical strains, the beauty of phrasing and fell in love with the melodies right alongside Darien (Dare) as he discovered each new composition by his highly fragile and volatile composer, the young Nicholas Becker. The Becker family had been in such dire straits, living in such desperation, I could believe they'd go along with Dare's offer of touring and exposing Becker's compositions to audiences all over Great Britain first and then all of Europe. But Darien's intentions and desperation run far deeper than simply new music for his audiences--and this greater, deeper plot made the story infinitely richer. Both Dare and Clara have significant beliefs that keep them apart: he believes music and love (for him) cannot coexist. Clara believes she can never step out of the obscurity of the shadows and claim her compositions; doing so will ruin her brother and the master violinist she's fallen in love with.

Characters were the most compelling I've read in ages, the quality of the writing superb, and the impact as I read each chapter pulled me deeper into the story and kept me riveted. I read the lengthy (just right in length, BTW) novel in nearly one sitting. I gave up everything else my day demanded to finish reading this amazing book. It fully earned every last star. The conclusion was likely the MOST rewarding option of any I could have possibly imagined. Congratulations, Ms. Lawson, for an incredibly well written book. It's obvious Ms. Lawson is either a gifted musician herself or had significant exposure to it or perhaps her husband (or child?) is the musician. Every bit of the music rang true and is correct as far as I can tell.

2291,1,A15PYCET4XH22X,B00FKKWQXY,"It is a true rarity that I give 1 or 2 star reviews on a book. Books that I simply can't into, I abandon and don't rate or review.

There are some books that are slow to start and end up entertaining.  Sadly, this isn't one of those.  I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I was hoping it would pick up?  It didn't.  Avery and her younger sister, June, are all that's left of a family. They live in a cave and venture out daily to hunt and train.  The setting is Post-Apocalytpic where humans are scattered.  Mutated humans and animals control the wold. Luckily, humans are still the smartest of the lot.

The bulk of the book is Avery thinking about protecting and taking care of her sister.  I don't think a few pages can go by without this inner-dialogue popping on page.  It gets annoying. We get it.

Urthmen would provide for an interesting backstory, but they appear to be functioning idiots.  This book is pretty predictable and the dialogue and lack of action are utterly annoying.

Create a box. Draw the character. Follow the recipe.  Had this book been a couple chapters long, it may have been a great start to a fun story.  I like the premise, the scenery, and the potential.

2292,1,A2UE9D1TQ3XGUH,B00FKKWQXY,"I hate giving negative reviews. I really do. I feel so bad writing negative things about a book that someone spent time and energy (and probably emotion) into writing. But, as this audiobook was provided to me by the author, narrator, or publisher at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review courtesy of Audiobook Blast, I am providing my honest opinion.

I had high hopes for this book. The premise was good; it has overall good ratings on Goodreads. I figured I would totally enjoy it and perhaps find a new series to explore. Sadly, that was not the case. The writing itself felt stilted and awkward. One reason for this that I could put my finger on was that the author(s) barely used any contractions. The first person narrative is told from the viewpoint of 17 year old Avery. Avery never uses a contraction in her thoughts and only very occasionally in her speech. It felt weird. It sounded even weirder listening to it. Her little sister June used contractions when she spoke and sounded completely normal.

Storywise...honestly, I was totally bored for at least the first third of the book and if I hadn't said I'd provide a review, I'd have abandoned it there. I kept wondering if the story was going anywhere or if the whole book was just going to be Avery and June going about their daily activities. This book is short-- only 5 hours on audio-- and yes, the bulk of it is Avery and June doing every day stuff or telling us about doing every day stuff. We hear about what an awesome hunter and fighter Avery is, then see it a few times. Then Avery acts like a silly teenage girl in hormone overdrive when she sees a teenage boy for the first time. Then, instead of being the level headed, focused young woman that she was for the earlier part of the book, she becomes obsessed with his rippling muscles, sunkissed skin and thick, dark hair. What little storyline there was seemed to go in circles and not get anywhere. I understand this is the first book in the series and a setup for the rest, but there has to be something of substance to engage the reader and keep them wanting to read. This book did neither for me.

As far as the audiobook production, the reader is decent but nothing spectacular. I loved her voice for June but thought she did not do a good job with the male voices. Her general narrative voice was OK but the cadence felt a little off, though this is most likely due to the writing itself and not the reader. I read a chapter or two on my kindle (it was free on Amazon) and the writing had that same strange cadence I was hearing on the audio. I think the reader would likely do a fine job with better material.

All in all, I'd recommend skipping this book-- both the audio and the print versions.",Skip this one,21,2/18/2016

The story was paced perfectly. Peter's recovery and how he overcame his trust issues wasn't rushed, and we take the journey with him as his mindset slowly changes and his heart opens thanks to the help of Thomas, as well as Alex, Leo and his therapist.

Thomas of course had his own issues to contend with - the age difference between he and Peter, and the fact he'd been alone for so long, only ever training Doms and subs before finding them more permanent arrangements.

It was refreshing to find that instead of using BDSM to help Peter in his recovery, Thomas showed Peter the joys of life, which in turn enabled Peter to experience what true submission under the care of a responsible, caring Dom was like.

Therefore, I would highly recommend this book to students in grades 3-8. This is a wonderful, factual accounting of six sea turtles. The book is full of engaging facts that are incredibly stimulating. I personally learned several new impressive facts. The text is easy to read. However, I wish the layout of the word spacing and columns were more consistent and easier on the eyes. I love the pictures. Unfortunately, I think the pictures are too small. They should be larger. Additionally, when the pictures are enlarged, by the reader tapping on the picture, the clarity of the sea turtle diminishes.

So. This book hit the spot. Literally in Jocelyn's case since Ian knows his ways around a lady's hot buttons. She tosses aside her inhibitions, he puts aside his concerns about getting busy with a coworker. And the sex was PHENOMENAL. As it often is with those hunky Scottish men.

This is the second of the Danny Jabo adventures written by Todd Tucker. However, for no apparent reason at all, I am reviewing it third. I have read, reviewed, and enjoyed the other two submarine adventures, and I THINK this completes the set. Keep yer eyes peeled, though, because a writer this good, with this much source material to work with, will surely be writing more.
Unlike the other two works, this doesn't have a great deal of sub-plots (see what I did there?) going on. It's all relatively straightforward: the attack sub Boise goes Dutchman, and Jabo & company, on the Louisville, try to find it. BUT!
But it's not straightforward, either, because the story isn't about (mostly) the Boise or the Louisville; it's about the people, the crew, on those ships. And so we learn enough about the sailor who had fallen in love, and gone AWOL, in enough degree that we care about him and the woman he found to belong to. We learn about the nuke, who was rescued from poverty and a rotten home, and given a job, responsibility, and found meaning. And we learn about the hard-working noob, first time on the boat, who is faced with despair because he just hasn't had time to learn how to use ANY of the equipment yet.
Yup, there is plenty of Clancy-like narrative of how the intricate machinery on the sub works together to keep her bravely driving along, quietly, after every single man aboard has perished. Frankly, while I started out feeling sorry for the AWOL sailor, and what he had lost through dying young, I wound up caring about the Boise herself, doing a Dutchman.
There's really not much tension or suspense in the story. What exists comes from the fact that the submarine service, in addition to containing competent, hard-working men of integrity, also contains some utter jerks who operate under the belief that performance is a zero sum game: if someone else does well, that means it reflects poorly on them. The executive officer aboard the Louisville is an officer of this type, and the captain knows it. And later, we have the fact that the ghost ship is headed straight for Hong Kong, and must be stopped before then.

Anne Best is getting a bit bored after raising two daughters alone in Texas after death of her husband. She, on a lark, decided to apply for a job in New York city referred by a headhunter, figure that she'd at least see NYC that she'd never seen. She did not count on being called to interview for PA position for billionaire Steven Gherring, who's not only one of the city's most eligible bachelors, he wanted to stay single. However, his Gram wanted very much to change that status for him. Gherring had already ran off most candidates and Anne was the only one who went toe to toe with him, earning his respect despite lacking PA experience. Anne is both clumsy and fearless in tackling her responsibilities including her boss, with two exceptions... she refused to participate in public speaking, and she avoids her own feelings. When Gram recruited Anne for finding a suitable woman for Gherring, Anne chose to ignore her own feelings for the frustratingly handsome billionaire. How can a guy like him be interested in an old widow from Texas? He, however, has other plans as well...

The book deftly mixed tropes such as matchmaker, different worlds, Cyrano, family expectations, and more. Add a bit of suave French seduction, some Gherring family secrets including a manipulative ex, and the ""action"" is non-stop. Furthermore, the book is PG rated with no sex!

I was amazed how much I cared about each of the different characters in the book, even the co-workers, friends, and neighbors, and I hope that I get to see the various characters again in future books in the series.

The romance in this story was sweet and clean but not boring.  Anne and her men, yes there is more than one love interest but I won't give spoilers, keep things interesting in the romance department but Anne is committed to no sex outside of marriage and the author is committed to no yucky descriptions so the reader gets some sweet kisses and the knowledge that the characters are intensely attracted to each other without the reader feeling dirty.

My only disappointment with the story is the use of five or six profanities throughout the story.  Because of the profanities, I lowered my rating from five stars to four stars.  I did not feel that the profanities were necessary.  They were just used in general conversation - the characters were not under extreme duress or danger.  At other times alternate phrases such as 'ohmygosh' were used.
UPDATE 9/27/17 I am thrilled to report that the author did not realize that profanities still existed in ""Her Best Match"" and they are now all gone!  She actually made the final updates several weeks ago and it has taken me awhile to get Amazon to update my copy of the book and then get this review edited.  I have raised my rating for ""Her Best Match"" to 5 stars and am recommending this book now with no reservations.

Sex - married couple talks of making love and some kissing takes place but fade away before actual sex occurs then return with couple tangled in sheets/sleeping but there is no descriptions of body parts or even nakedness.
Language - none
Violence - two unwelcome sexual advances that are thwarted by bystanders
Religion - none",Funny and sweet romance with great characters,3,8/17/2017

I have to be honest, and I know this is going to make me look back, but when I first started reading the book and found out the age of the female lead, I wasn't thrilled. There's nothing wrong with the mid-40s, but I prefer younger characters. Apparently I didn't realize that before picking this book up. Anyway, that was all soon forgotten because this book is one of the best books I've ever read. I can't praise it enough! All I kept thinking the whole book through was, ""why isn't this a movie?!?!"" This would be perfect for Hallmark or the big screen!

I love how the characters are multi-dimensional. Nothing boring happens. Tons of excitement and adventure. The way the two lead characters finally end up together is brilliant. I love how there were stories beyond the main characters, too. It just made it seem like you were in the female lead's world.

Two of my favorite lines are: ""You belong with me"" and ""Everything I do means something.""

How could the head of huge corporation actually put up with someone as stupid, and witless as Anne? She was supposed to be charming, warm and made friends with everyone - that was okay - but then she lied, cried, manipulated and talked over the top of the hero - cutting him off every time he tried to talk to her - stormed out in the night when she was warned not to...oh dear.

Not only that, she bossed everyone around, forced them to match up the way she wanted and then pouted when it didn't suit her. This woman was supposed to be 45 and a sensible mother of adults? Quite frankly, the girls were more mature than she was. I can't see what the hero saw in her and he was - seriously - a gorgeous hunk of 50  - yes FIFTY - who'd never been married?

I've been sharing examples of the bad writing on Facebook.  The four- and five-star reviews are mind-boggling.

UPDATE:  So I finished the book, and I upgraded my rating from 1 star to 3 stars.  My interest in the story picked up around page 60, and I was interested in the story enough to finish the book.  And even though I kind of liked the story, I can't in good conscious give this book 4 stars because the writing was so juvenile and simplistic.  There wasn't a single believable character in the book.  The dialogue was completely unrealistic.  Anne vacillated between acting like a 16-year-old girl and a 72-year-old woman.  Most of the time I had her pictured in my mind like someone's grandmother.  I thought she was rather stupid.  I had the twist figured out by page 3, not because of anything in the book but simply my reader's intuition.  I did like the Switzerland segment.  It made me want to visit.

The author took the love scenes just far enough for you to feel the electricity in the relationship without all of the details.  I think that is a very delicate balance, and the author accomplished it.  I always like to look at the one star reviews to see what might be wrong with a book.  But I think many people misread this one.  It is a light-hearted read to be enjoyed.  It's not a deep book that will leave you thinking about it for days to come.

2328,4,A1Y4344LVJ9KPB,B00FR30D16,"Texas widow Anne Best has always prided herself in her matchmaking skills but when she is set up by a head hunter to work with New York finance billionaire Steven Gherring the tables get turned on her instead. With her native Texas drawl and personal charisma, she charms everyone she meets in the Big Apple, including her boss, Mr. Gherring. Along the way, she meets wealthy Frenchman Henri, who is also a partner in Gherring's financial empire and Henri is smitten with the beautiful mid-40's widow. For someone who is not in the marriage mart, Mr. Gherring does not like this one bit. It is obvious that Anne is smart, savvy, and naturally competent in everything she tries except her own romantic feelings. There, she is completely clueless as she tackles the daunting task of finding her almost 50-ish boss a suitable marriage partner. Steven is a lifelong bachelor, handsome and fit to a fault, an international media celebrity and the probably the world's most desirable marriage target. Anne finds herself employed by Steven as his personal assistant. What ensues is a whirlwind of trips abroad, crash courses in finances, and Anne's best attempts at staying close to her two young adult single daughters. As Steven tries to come to terms with his growing affection for Anne, there are more poorly-times interruptions when he tries to convey his feeling to Anne than a Hallmark movie. Anne needs a gentle-slap-up-along-side-the-head as practically everyone can see her growing desire for Steven except herself! She wonders what this dynamic powerhouse of a man can see in her humble Texas roots. Anne also is befriended by Mr. Gherring's 95 year old headstrong grandmother who has her own match to make for her wealthy grandson. The characters are all fleshed out and well-developed; The dialogue is delightful, the situations that naive' Anne gets herself into are hilarious. My only annoyances in the story involved Anne who seemingly cried at every opportunity. What a watering pot! Also, I found the length of the story a bit drawn out at 400+ pages and I personally prefer romances in the 300 page length. I also appreciated how the author kept the bedroom door firmly shut and not a word of profanity was uttered throughout. This was a romantic, yet wholesome tale (but with subtle sexy undertones) that I still could have given to my 16 year old granddaughter to read without reservations.

2329,5,A1JE234N7AACMA,B00FR30D16,"Anne Best had been widowed for 15 years. After both of her daughters moved out and were on their own, she realized life was boring. Putting out her resume in the hopes of finding something new to do, she jumped at the chance to interview for an executive assistant position in New York City. Not because she thought she'd get it, but because the trip was fully paid for and at least she'd get a break from her dull existence in Weatherford, TX. To her surprise, she was offered the job and then her entire world changed.

Anne was also a matchmaker. She instinctively knew when two people would hit it off. In the process, she decided her boss, Mr. Stephen Gherring, was lonely and would benefit from having someone who could love and care for him and not his money or the prestige of being seen with him. Too bad all of her attempts at setting him up with someone failed. Her own attempts at dabbling her toes back in the dating pool also kept backfiring. Maybe moving to New York City had been a mistake.

While the reader can see where this book is headed from a mile away, it's still a delightful read. The lighthearted and clean romance is a breath of fresh air in this day and time of tawdry scenes being tossed in just because. It's also nice to have older characters for once. Not everyone is in the 20s and looking perfect.

Anne is a joy to read. Her inability to lie worth a darn can be absolutely hilarious. She's quite personable and I found her charming.

Stephen is also an interesting character. A powerful business man with quite the reputation, and yet, maybe everything isn't quite as it appears.

I really like older heroes and heroines.  45 is not old but certainly an age where most have experienced life, etc.  So, I was looking forward to this 45 year old getting out and living life on her terms and finding love again.  I think that is where this story was going.  I found it rather hard to believe that the CEO/owner of a huge New York City company would be THAT impressed with a woman from Texas dressed rather out of style,  with no experience in being a personal assistant  --- I am a mother and to me there is nothing about being a mother that would qualify you to be the PA to a big shot in New York.  Anyway, I found their connection to be a big hard to believe.

The heroine did seem awfully immature for a 45 year old, mother of 2, widowed for many years.  The trying to match everyone she came in contact with was more like an elderly grandmotherly type than a 45 year old sexy chick.  I say that because her first afternoon in New York she gets dressed to go to the gym in a pair of too short shorts and a tank top.  That seemed a bit young for a person 45.  Not that 45 is not a sexy age, it is, it just seemed a bit much for going to the gym in her building when she has no idea of the clientele, etc.  This story was not really working for me so I decided to go back and reread some of the reviews.  I fit more with the 2 star reviewers than I did the others.  I decided to quit since it really wasn't working for me.

I gave it three stars because I think the story is ok and that a lot of readers will like it, it just wasn't working for me.

It caused a scandal and a lot of press attention because her family was rich and socially prominent.

The second book is about her brother she didn't know she had. When she was kidnapped he was injured trying to rescue her. His injuries were very bad so the family hired a family friend who was a therapist to help him. When they started having feelings for each other bad things start to happen to her.

The stories were all well told but could have used some more careful editing. I hate it when people use breath for breathe. You breathe when you take a breath.

The werewolf is a bit of a bigot who hates humans and everything about our expanding human culture. In this book the tale is told from the perspective of a xenophobic werewolf what a hoot. This is not a traditional werewolf tale with lots of transforming going on. I found the book hard to finish because it plods along too much of the time. The premise is unusual but it is milked way too much.  The people are not well developed so you don't really end up caring a whole lot about if they live or die. The werewolf is well developed but is not fun, funny or likable. In a good book there should always be one character you like or identify with and this book has none.

I like this book only because I enjoy a  good book about werewolves. I only wish this was a good book about werewolves.  This is an ok book about a very weird werewolf like being. The book is technically well written but the story itself is boring and not well told. The story is one demensional in the fact that you don't care one bit about anyone in the book including the werewolf. Reading this book is like looking at a correctly set up chess board. You see like a pre set chess board in this book you observe lots of potential for adventures big and small but none of it has yet been effectively realized.

This book is like listening to the Archie Bunker of Werewolves talk about human culture as he wanders through it. The book has a novel concept but it just does not fly with me.

2336,5,A1LN5E20PUFY3S,B00FU9RR0M,"I believe this is the 2nd of Mr. Merritts books I read. The first was A Gift of Time, and that was certainly enjoyable enough to make me want to experience all of his stories. I purchased his entire library after finishing A Gift of Time. I very much like that each of his books is a standalone story.

Im struggling, though. I cant decide if this one was my favorite, or if A Gift of Diamonds was. Maybe Im leaning a little harder towards A Gift of Diamonds 

I am a product of the 50s and 60s  that was my youth  and Mr. Merritt nailed the feeling of the period. It was well done enough that I was reminiscing of my own youth as I read this one. I also lived in the Tampa area through the mid-70s and early 80s. The rural areas of West central and Central Florida were very much as described in this story. I probably made it up to Pensacola once or twice, but Florida was Florida in those days. The scenes described brought back some very fond memories for me. Yes, there were some very nasty people back then, but rural folks by and large back then took care of things as needed. Some younger folks today might misconstrue what I just said, but Ill just say that crime back then was not what it is today.

His characters, especially the kids, were superbly created, as was their dialog. Far too often authors writing children or teenage characters lapse into adult thought patterns and speech. It could have happened some here, but it was truly a minimal impact. Great job there!
I found the writing exceptional. Some very minor editing errors through the book, but nothing that impaired my reading.
If I have a gripe at all, its the same gripe I have with any 1st person point of view. I don't like a 1st person narrative for a host of reasons. 1) I don't want to be the main character. 2) The main character thinks, speaks and behaves in ways I would not. 3) It doesnt matter who the author is  I always find the 1st person MC lacks the depth of every other character. That happens in this book, as well. There were certainly times when I could not relate to, or understand the MC. Behavior, emotion, responses or action, which should have been logically present, were absent. It was enough to throw me off kilter during the reading and, for me, detracted from what is a superb read.

I did find myself wishing for more information on what was happening in the background, or with several characters. I was a bit disappointed that once the story moved past a characters necessary involvement that they completely disappeared. Such as Alexis parents  a sentence or two explaining what became of supporting characters would have been greatly appreciated. I finished this book wondering what became of many of the people impacting the life of these kids. Or, how the kids managed to make things work to their benefit  such as the purchase of the steel hulled boat. Who crewed the thing? How? When? Who monitored the business while they were all off to college? There were too many of these gaps in the narrative which could have been easily corrected by a few sentences, yet weren't 

I concur with some other reviewers  Mr. Merritt tends to end his books rather abruptly. In the case of this book I was left fairly annoyed with the MCs attitude. Again, 1st person  not how I would have thought, felt or behaved  but he was just too  detached. That last sentence in the book? I truly needed another sentence or two to complete the story for me.

Overall, this book was a wonderful experience for me. It took me right out of my daily world and put me in a happy place. THAT is the mark of a truly wonderful story experience.",Outstanding,5,3/23/2017

The story rambled a bit, and the plot could have been filled out a bit more. I didn't really care for any of the characters, and felt the resolution fell a bit flat. No suspense there, which would have added a great deal to the story. The red herrings were interesting, but could have been used to greater extent.

The people I met on this journey were,for the most part, caring and and gracious--with the exception of one Uriah Wainwright, a devil who delighted in treachery and torment, especially with a branding iron held against our spunky heroine, Jane. However, as in all great love stories, the hero---Ethan Gordon, magnificent beast that he is, swoops in and rescues our Jane both from certain death and a loveless life of loneliness. Ethan and Jane become the heart of the story. They at once hate each other. Jane is a proud Lady of a plantation while Ethan is a semi-mercenary. Jane thinks Ethan is a big oaf while Ethan thinks Jane is a spoiled brat. When he purchases her to save her life and then marries her for the same reason, the fireworks truly begin.

However, as you can tell by my rating I wasn't much impressed. It's the story of Colleen Malone, a young Irish woman unjustly convicted of a crime and transported to the penal colony in Australia where she is forced into prostitution. After winding up pregnant, she's forced to leave her dearest cousin behind and work hard labor at the prison, also known as The Factory.... Samuel Biggs is distraught after losing his beloved wife and decides to leave England behind and start fresh in Australia. His employers wife convinces him to find a helpmate and takes him to The Factory to pick one out whereby he meets Colleen and before either of them knows it, they're married... Colleen carries her secret though and Samuel is determined that their marriage remain an ""arrangement"" only. In the end, Samuel will have to overcome the past and his fears and Colleen will have to fight for his love and her baby's future if they're ever to find happiness together...

The story started out very good and I thought for sure I was going to love it. However, it lost steam quickly and felt sluggish to me the rest of the way for the most part. I liked Samuel and Colleen who were nice people overall, but I didn't sense a great passion between them. Instead the relationship felt more like one of friendship and their marriage one of simply convenience. I also didn't like Colleen's continuous deceit and Samuel constantly pushing her away and often coldness toward her. Then there was the ongoing story of James and Thea (from book one) and when some of James's past actions come to light there are major complications for the couple, but the author never gives them any resolution. I thought the ending was abrupt and it was definitely due for an epilogue, but no such luck. Then there's the editing which needs a complete overhaul. Honestly, whoever edited this should be embarrassed, its that terrible!

2389,3,A1TWV867HVZ60,B00G64F9XM,"The idea on this book grabbed my attention, but its so slow and dry, I put it down/picked it up several times before I finished it.  The Dom is so wishy-washy and so hung up on his past that he didn't act like a Dom.  After his friends chastised him several times for the way he treated the little submissive that I wanted to reach into the story and slap him.  Yes Angel lied when she portrayed a Domme at the one club, but when she explained why she did it, Adam couldn't forgive her.  You would think he would have understood her fear of entering a club alone and into the unknown so she took the stance as a Domme to see how it all worked.  No one was hurt, she didn't play a scene, just looked at the club and saw the personal interactions.  Several editing errors that need to be fixed, but over all the story was ok.  As this is Book 1, the author told the story on several of the characters as if the reader should know what the Venus school is and how the Menage happend.  The reader is lost on how the others in the ""friends"" group got together, so there is either the prequel missing or this is an off shoot of another series.

 not.","Slow and Dry, Dom is a wishy-washy Dom  - not impressed.",2,3/12/2018

If communication is the cornerstone to BDSM then these two are severely lacking in this area at least in the beginning. She's freewheeling,  spontaneous,  has male roommates, a quick temper, is an actress and keeps him off balance. He's button down, organized,  suspicious,  jealous, mistrustful and controlling. Doesn't sound like a match made in heaven...right? Despite their differences and even with all the hiccups and missteps along the way, their D/s relationship slowly leads to love.

I really enjoyed this book.  Meeting the great cast of characters involved in future books was a treat. They are all complex and interesting.  I liked that Angel and Adam's story was patiently unfolded. Even though it was lust at first sight they had to work to get to where they ended up....in love.

2391,5,A39BS5Z2VD50RM,B00G64F9XM,"After reading and editing this book for the author, I felt compelled to leave a review. I have read some of the reviews for this book. I do not agree with some of them. This book is about BDSM. So, if you are not comfortable with this topic, do not read it. If you love it, have a great read here. Angel, a young women that wants to be someones submissive. But, to make sure she knows what to expect when she goes to the Stronghold Club, she first goes to a different BDSM club and poses as a Dominant female or Domme (pronounced doe-may). While there she runs into some of the Dominant males from Stronghold Club. When Master Adam sees her, he doesn't understand why he is attracted to her. He is never attracted to a Domme only a submissive is for him. But the next time he sees her, she says she is a submissive. Master Adams is totally confused and doesn't believe Angel when she tries to explain to him the truth. Can Adam move past his issues with trusting someone? Can Angel really find the Master she so desires? Well, pick this one up for a great read.

 This book begins the stories of the Stronghold, there are more books to follow this one. I loved this book and I loved working with the author on it. I look forward to all books this author puts out. I read one review where that person called this a ""Classic writing of an abusive Dominant.""  Master Adam is not an abusive Dominant. He is good at what he does. Angel doesn't feel he abused her.  In real live, I am a Domme. I love reading stories others write on this topic so I can find out what others think about this lifestyle. Angle has done her research. She knows what can and does happen in any lifestyle. As the books go on, you will find Dominants that really care for and love their submissives. I hope you that read this story and the ones to follow in this series will enjoy them as much as I did. I also hope you will understand that in all life things can and do go wrong.

2392,5,A3LV3TEBGFSYDX,B00G64F9XM,"If I was a writer I might be able to explain how much I loved this book, but I'm not, and I'm practically speechless.
Ok, I'm going to start with something simple, the length. It might not be a big deal to some, but I love my books long and full of detail. This one satisfied me perfectly with both of those things. I also love well developed characters who are complex and sometimes surprising in their actions and words. Again, this one had that. Not only were Adam and Angel perfect, but they are surrounded by numerous friends and family who have the same qualities. The romance was natural and lustfull, and I actually teared up even though I knew it would end in a HEA. I also loved that this book is just a romance. There isn't suspense or danger. There isn't any mystery or violent ex. The story is just about Adam and Angel trying to navigate through their feelings for each other. I loved the glimpses into their thoughts and the mixed POV. I loved that by the end of the story I knew the characters well enough to have an idea about how they would react to something. The characters were SO REAL!
I tried to pace myself, because I didn't want to stop reading this, but I still reached the last page. Now, I sit here, desperately wanting to dive into the next book, but instead I'm sitting here trying to convince you that you NEED this book. Trust me, YOU DO NEED IT! It is everything that makes a wonderful story. EVERYTHING! I could have spent months reading about Adam and Angel, and their wedding, children, grandchildren, etc... I'm sure you get the point, but I also want to find out about the lives of the other members of Stronghold. I know I will read this book over and over, and I know any romance lover will enjoy it just as MUCH as I did.",I am so in love with this book!,5,1/25/2018
2393,3,AZPNSCZH6LW40,B00G64F9XM,"Oh dear.  Classic writing of an abusive Dominant.  When the main characters finally first scene together at something like 30%, the Dominant is in a really bad head space.  He is supposed to be a Professional Dominant or Master, he is semi-employed for his skills as such by the Stronghold Club.  He is in charge of Introductory Scenes, involving newbie submissives, their introduction to the Club lifestyle, and testing them out.  Leading them.  Caring for them.  Instead, he is blisteringly angry with the female lead, he is written as so out of control that he is abusive.  Abusive in his Dominant role, not the scene, in which Adam multiple times asks Angel to confirm her comfort level.  The abuse was firstly that he had no business scene-ing when he was out of control.  Even his friends and Club acquaintances knew Adam was in the wrong.  Secondly, he refused this complete newbie submissive Aftercare.  Refused it to her although she was in subspace.  Get dressed, get out.  Other characters had to intervene to stop Adam and care for Angel.  He should have been kicked out of Stronghold.  No questions, no excuses, do not collect $200, do not pass Go.  What was just written is a dangerous Dom, not a book boyfriend.

Writing BDSM is difficult.  I know this.  Yet by giving your readers the character of Master Adam who fails in his duty as a Dominant, a Master, a Trainer, a Club member and employee, and as a Scene Partner, the trust between reader and author is broken.  At not one other time throughout this and future books can we trust that abuse versus the true tenets of BDSM will occur.

2396,4,A2GTSDWHMTKBJS,B00G757PB4,"After the sex, what else is there? Chris hadnt found much until he found Robyn. Youve got to read this book! Afterwards is the book that makes you question when do people really fall in love. Is there love at first sight and were really just too dense to realize it? Is love a tiny seed that is planted by destiny because people like Chris Shaife would run like hell if he ever suspected cupids arrow was anywhere close to his heart? I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel and watching the way love crept up on this couple. There is something magical about the way the author unravels the details of this romance, the way the love actually builds and insecurities peek through, and the way people find out little details about themselves that make them better mates for the other person.

Chris actually claimed Robyn for himself from the beginning of the story; he just didn't know it. When she soothed away his headache and took care of him, he was hooked. From that point on, we see him orchestrating her life as smoothly as he successfully manipulates the rest of the music industry even though he doesnt think thats what hes doing when he suggests her for a job and arranges private weekly lessons with a motorcycle champion so that he can have her close by. With his lousy track record with women, Chris is too afraid to drag Robyn into his life, but hes not willing to totally step away, either. The problem is, as the physical attraction becomes obvious, Robyn doesnt do yo-yo love. The mixed messages and double standards don't work for her.

Robyn is fascinating.  Shes strong enough to be a daredevil, secure enough to handle the ego of a alpha man who makes her feel completely vulnerable when they're alone, and brave enough to face the heartache of his reaction when life throws their relationship a curveball. Nia Forrester manages to create a truly amazing story about the complexity of an independent, ambitious, career-driven woman who faces life and love with so much courage and grace that the reader can only sigh, cheer her on, and plot Chris untimely demise when he turns out to be a jerk. Robyn is devastated, but shes too strong to be defeatedand that makes Chris realize that he loves her. Yeah, the light bulb finally clicks on.

The author makes us examine what strong-willed people need from their significant others and turns on its head the notion of a dominant man needing a subservient, adoring, fan to stroke his ego and fetch his slippers. Additionally, the independent and self-sufficient female can still have a hero every now and then. Nia Forrester eventually restores our faith in men and delivers a plausible happy ending, but she does it by clearly showing that relationships have to be worth fighting for. This couple learns to fight for each other, change a few priorities, and to protect what they have.

Harmony is the underlying theme of this series set around finding love within the music industry. Will every couple find it? Obviously not.

After the initial sweet loving person, another colder calculated woman emerged. Yes Chris needed a strong career minded woman, but Robyn began to be too much. All the baby's momma's were just too crazy. I liked the way Ms. Forrester weaved and bobbed a newer fresher Chris into a man to feel good about. The ancillary characters brought vibrancy and a little bit of rashness that made the storyline gripping. Robyn never endeared herself with me, I just could not make a clear connection. In this story, there was just enough drama and loving, and friendship to keep the story moving.

In this clever plot, the treasure is whisked away before the Spanish conquistadors can complete their siege. The flashbacks to the young map maker gives us a refreshing peak into the scenario explaining how the current circumstances have evolved. Unfortunately for a young archeological student bent on following his (native) sweetheart's ancient map, he gets a little too close. Following his brutal murder, his extremely wealthy grandparents enlist the aid of long time friend and pseudo-son, Prof. David Manning, who promises to look into a death summarily dismissed by the local (crooked) sheriff as a drug deal gone bad. Prof. Manning proves to be a pit bull, not only in his dogged effort at digging out the truth, but then setting up the dog fight that ends in the rescue of the young man's lover as well as the recovery of riches. Manning enjoys the help of the interim deputy after the death of the sheriff as the bad guys will stop at nothing to cover their tracks and protect their cache. I thought the story flowed well enough to keep my attention and turning pages, but as has been noted before, this book is full of typos and other edit problems.

I even read an ARC I got and had to get reviewed in the middle of the two book set and I truly could not give my mind over to that because I could only think about this book! Oh Tier how I love you I even get tears in my eyes to type his name but truly he is such a fine fine man/alien/bird/leader/bad crazy man whichever you want to call him but I LOVE Tier and I love Junco! And until you get to the point in the book that you understand the dynamics of all the characters you may misunderstand some of them you might think Tier is too hard but he IS not and once you realize the life she has had you will realize that Tier is not abusive in ANY way, harsh yes but in this world they are living it is harsh it is hard as all get out, I would never survive! Lucan oh I really like Lucan I thought for a while I loved Lucan and in a way I do but nothing like Tier, now did you get that l Love Tier and I Love Junco  lol I cried for them both! This story just ""IS"" that is all I can say about it. I know in a lot of JA Huss books are thought of  as Mindtwist (we use another word but I cannot say that here) kind of way but I dunno if this is a Mindtwist but it is just Beautiful all in its own fine Glory! I am so sad it is over truly I am, I loved being in that pretend world I loved reading it, finding time, stealing moments to just grab a minute of that world when I really didn't have time to even read a word but I did because for me I just had to, I could not stop it would not go off or out of my mind. I have dreamed it, sweated over it, smiled, laughed, loved and of course cried quite a few times heck I feel like I Lived it! And that people is how you are supposed to FEEL when you read a Good Book, well not a Good Book but an Excellent Book a Superior Book

You Woman Truly Blew me away with this book I will read it many many other times in years to come and yes I might skip and skim around if I want to because I might be able to but probably not  And I will refer this Book to everyone I know, it is Long but oh so worth it! It took me a couple of days to even write this to share my feelings of it and as I promised the Ladies in the Shrike Bikers FB page everyone after my last crazy rant on that page, this is it, here it is for all its Glory but for the most part I want for you people to READ This Book Set, seriously forget all the others and Read this NOW! If I ever wanted a signed book it would be this set, you know I have tried winning and of course I will continue because it's fun and I love when she has a new book just as everyone does and I know she gives so many things away hell every time we turn around this woman is giving away stuff, swag, books, blankets to wrap up and have sex with your hubby in lol and its all for us to read her books because she Loves us, her fans! You JA Huss are the best and your mind is Brilliant. If I had just a speck of her miraculous talent I'd have it made in this world but since I don't I get to enjoy all of her works of art!!! And truly that is what they are to me and I truly did love 321 and Rook and Ronin, Ford, Spencer, the kids (cant wait for Five), Mateo, I haven't met Rock, James, Vaughn or Merc yet but I have the books well I need the second set of Media and all of her new folks she is writing but I will soon enough I will because she is someone that it truly doesn't matter what it is she writes I will read it, We will read it! But in Junco She makes you feel, I am not even sure how to describe it, my feelings I mean they are just Fluttery? Is that even a feeling lol I am just a mess truly a Fluttering Mess! If you want to feel this fantastic book then dive in folks and let's get the first book she wrote over on top were it truly should be! And I know this bit of info from her EOBS and it is a freaking awesome EBOS! Thank you Julie A Huss for giving me Junco and Tier for giving me this story to buy and read and to share my Fluttery!

2418,4,AWX97WZY341D0,B00GA0NURO,"I really struggled to get through the first 10-15% of the Omnibus. It is nothing like what I have read from JA Huss. Something totally different. If you don't like having to work for your great endings and being a little lost, this book is definitely not for you. But after getting about 18% through I could not put it down.

Clutch

This series starts with you completely in the dark! I was so confused as to what was going on and who the characters were. She does go into details but I felt it was not about another important such as characters and plot (what is actually going on) and the universe we are being dropped into. But as you read.. you learn more and more information that slowly pulls you out of the dark. Toward the end of this first book you actually get a chance to enjoy the story that in unfolding and many of the details get filled in. You are left with a Cliffhanger wondering what is going to happen with Junco's absolutely crazy life. But this is really the only story that don't have somewhat of wrap up.

Fledge

Julie does a great job of making you work through this book. It I'd no where near see confusing as the first one and I was completely hooked. This book kept me want more and more and I absolutely refused to put it down. You before completely invested in Junco and everything that revolves around her. Huss hits you right in the feels a few times throughout this book installment. But I'm never one to complain about ups and downs in a book. She gives a pretty good end for this one, not really leaving you with a cliffhanger but making you want more than anything to find out what is going to happen next.

Flight

Flight is ridiculously action packed and I cant complain one bit about it. I absolutely loved it. Huss does switched between whats going on and ""dreams/flashbacks"" which leave me a little confused and I wasn't too fond of this aspect of the book. There are also part in the book were I wish Julie would have used more of a proper noun/name instead of a pronoun because the pronoun leaves me totally lost on who is talking/even what they are talking about.

For all of the old school urban/street lit heads that know all about Wahida Clark's Thug Series, and the old school queens like Nikki Turner, Danielle Santiago, Tracy Brown and Keisha Ervin...you'll know exactly what I'm talking about if and when you read this story.

I've been reading urban lit for over 10 years now, and everybody ain't able when it comes to giving us a good story. As I told the author, this is hands down one of the best series that I've read in a long time.

Not only does she give us detailed descriptions and characters that you can relate to, she also gives us a lengthy manuscript. The book doesn't end in 30-45 mins. It's not so long were it's full of air leaving you saying, ""dang she could have ended this book a long time ago""...you actually will hate when it ends.

2420,2,A2A41ZRVMO8WG2,B00GA8XBSE,"The blurb says it all - there's really no need to bother anybody with another recap.

This book belonged to the romantic suspense category but I'm sorry to say that neither the romance nor the suspense part of the book could persuade me, especially because both parts lacked atmosphere and love for details. The plot was one-dimensional and completely predictable.

 More specifically,the suspense part of the book was very linear. There were exactly 2 potential candidates who could be the stalker. There's nothing wrong with that had there been more elaboration around them. However, the author preferred to literally present the villain at the end of the book - just like that and out of the blue. There was a short explanation why the stalker did what s/he did but these weren't developed throughout the plot and so they fell flat instead of being an integral part of the plot.

Not that the romance part was any better. Instead of generating atmosphere and creating a pull between the hero/ine, the author chose to describe every last detail regarding real estate and construction work.

Generally speaking, I didn't enjoy the book at all. As an avid suspense romance reader, I was surprised that there were so many positive reviews. In any case,  I'm sure it's my fault that I just couldn't get the vibes of the book.",So many positive reviews?,7,9/15/2016
2421,4,A30L7ES6E5PS0U,B00GAPUDKQ,"This book, Vegan Cookbooks: 70 of the Best Ever Healthy Breakfast Recipes for VegetariansRevealed!, was written by Samantha Michaels in a simple and effective manner, lacking any filler material. I will initially state I am confused as to how this cookbook is sufficient for both vegans and vegetarians. These terms are not interchangeable. Yes, vegetarians can eat vegan dishes and vegans can eat vegetarian dishes (when dairy products are substituted). However, I believe the title should have picked one or the other and remained constant to that subset of individuals. The book begins with a table of contents, which does contain page numbers on which one can locate the recipes; but also, on the Kindle version of the book, each section of the book is written in a hyperlink fashion, in order to enable to user to simply click the section head they are interested in prior to being automatically directed to the first page of that section. I consider the hyperlinks to be a nice, easy method to flip to a certain chapter in this book. The table of contents is nicely set up for hyperlinks to the beginning of each chapter and each recipe, in addition to differentiating between the chapter and recipes by bolding the chapter title. However, the table of contents is awkwardly setup in terms of layout, such as indentation and dots between the recipe and page number. Following a note from the author requesting book reviews, she delves into an introduction, which briefly overviews the benefits of a vegan diet. Chapters 1-9 contain the recipes for this diet plan. Each recipe has a title, ingredient list, mostly specific quantities for each ingredient, a picture of the dish, and directions. There are 6 egg-like recipes, 9 pancakes/waffles/crepes recipes, 5 French toast recipes, 8 muffin recipes, 9 biscuit recipes, 9 potato recipes, 8 fruit recipes, 8 granola recipes, and 8 cereal recipes. The recipes sound delicious, do not require an overwhelming amount of ingredients, and do not take an overwhelming amount of time to make. I enjoyed the lack of filler information in this book, the lack of grammatical or spelling errors, the vast array of recipes, and the taste of the recipes I have tried. My issue, and hence the reason for the 4-star review, is due to the layout of the book. The layout was slightly off, in my opinion. Some examples of this include the awkward placement of the recipe pictures and the lack of recipes generally starting on a new page. I simply prefer reading recipes in a more consistent and logical format, but it is certainly not a deal breaker for the book overall. I should also mention that the author occasionally writes recipes that call for vegan dairy products, while others call for non-vegan dairy products. I'm sure it was just a slip up and it doesn't happen often, so it is not a big deal. Similarly, for the debate of whether or not this cookbook is vegan or vegetarian, the recipes all seem to be vegan, with, as just mentioned, the occasional non-vegan ingredient accidentally thrown in. Beyond this, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to those interested in many delicious and healthy vegan/vegetarian recipes at an affordable price (free!).","Awkward Layout, but Excellent Recipes",2,2/13/2016
2422,2,A1RDSJ11T3DZPE,B00GAPUFXQ,"I have bipolar disorder so I was especially interested in how this book presented the topic. While there are bits of truly useful info in this book, it's written like a high school term paper. There is MUCH repetition. Most of it is written at an easy-reading level but then bits of complex terminology are tossed in without definition (or attribution), as if the author simply copied a line from an actual scientific article about bipolar disorder.

Ms. Rose repeatedly states how difficult it is to diagnose bipolar, how it presents itself differently in different people, but then says there are easy tests to take to self-diagnose. The title itself is misleading. I expected there to be an actual quiz in the book, but there are only references to several online tests without links to any of them.

I like her plain language, which is accessible to folks without advanced medical degrees. I think this is a topic that could use a book like this. But this book needs severe editing, like cutting out half of it to eliminate the repetition, and then adding more info to make it truly useful as a guide to defining bipolar disorder.

It is quite challenging having to live with someone who is Bipolar and learn to shoulder the storm as they are having their highs and lows. When I was a kid, I never could understand some of my mother's behaviors. Now that I know what's going on, I look back and understand completely (well as much as I possibly can without having suffered being Bipolar myself).

2426,4,A3ONV3WT19O37N,B00GAPUDCY,"First, let me start off with saying I am not Vegan. I collect cookbooks and vegan recipes have a place on my shelf (digital and physical) because I'm always looking for a new way to present veggies. I just choose not to make them the only thing I eat. I've become a fan of Samantha Michaels cookbooks because they have always managed to be a step above the standard grocery store recipe scam. You know... ""buy only X brand mayo and mix with X brand tuna..."" You won't see that here. But you also will not be forced to flambe or fricassee anything. These recipes are a return to the straight forward style I prefer in a cookbook.

Now, for some constructive feedback: The layout is suffering from a completely disjointed look in the digital format that makes it harder to read than it should. Something that should take less than half a page is cut off in margins and forced to a new line. Meanwhile, images are taking up the other column of the page, but aren't taking the full area. More than half the images are blurry. Some of the images are less than inspiring to the point of being gross while others look professionally done. This tells me either the photographer is a student, the author or someone just pulled flash images off the net and stuck them in there (I hope not!) I'm also going to ding you for another recipe of fried potatoes. Keeping it simple is one thing, but milking potatoes for that one last recipe to make 70 is cheap. I would hope the reason people are buying this book is to expand beyond the horizon of the humble fried potato.

On the additionally positive side: less mention of banana and desserts make a come back in this book that is worth giving a try. Overall, this is another solid entry in her cookbook collection.

I confess I'm a sucker for covers showing the American flag, or the White House, or the Capitol Building. And, if I ""smell"" espionage, or in this case, ""Political Action Thriller"" I'm going there too.
This turned out to be a decent read. I admit that when I first got into it I wasn't sure.

I have a couple of friends who said I had to read this author, and since I had already had Rebel on my kindle, I decided to read it. I'm happy I did.
The comedy writing style in this book was different and refreshing. She had a quirky humor with the smart but comments made. Teagan's personality definitely doesn't come across as dull. She is what had me hooked from the start. Well her and her best friend Quinn.

Teagan's life is on a roller coaster going downhill and she is trying to do what she can to rise back up. When things are looking down and nothing is going her way, she finally puts her foot down and just goes for this job and almost doesn't let Rebel tell her no.

It was really nice reading about Teagan's and Rebel's story. It is told only in Teagan's POV vs dual which was a nice change up since a lot of dual now days. The writing style was great. The dialogue between the characters kept me drawn in, however I will say the romance between Rebel and Teagan could have been a little better. I feel like it kind of fell short. The banter was good and the writing really were good which is what had me hooked, but I think this book was more focused on the banter between the characters VS building up a Huge romance connection between them.

The book is a cultural history that focuses on the architecture, fashion, and urban fabric of Paris. In a series of chapters, DeJean explores the meaning of the Pont Neuf - the oldest standing bridge in Paris, the lighting of Paris that transformed the nightlife of the city, the construction of an island in the Seine that created some of the most noteworthy architecture of the time period, the creation of boulevards and parks, the destruction of the city walls, the creation of the Post, and the rise of Fashion, capital F.

If you know history, you may wonder if Paris really was the invention of a lot of these things. Fashion for instance, for those who know their history, is not something that existed only in Paris. Or that was created in fashion. So some of the chapters may stretch your ability to believe. But in terms of the chapters of architecture, the author does make a good case that we should be focusing on kings like Henri IV and Louis XIV when discussing the transformation of Paris. Baron Haussmann, supposedly, copied a lot of ideas that were already implemented in the 17th century.

This is a quick and easy read at around 300 pages. And it is an insightful book. Whether the modern city was invented in Paris is another question that I'm sure authors focused on other cities will have different answers to.

It seemed to me, that the author got tired of writing, and just wrapped it up, and walked away.  It felt like it just sorta ran out there and stopped. Not a cliffhanger, just not a real ending, either. It didn't hold my interest to the point that I would be interested in reading the rest of the series.

By: Megan Nugen Isbell
5 out of 5 stars

The story Here With Me by Megan Nugen Isbell is new adult/romance book. This is an amazing story the I loved reading. It is a story that had me hooked from the beginning and not wanting to put down until I had read the last page. I loved the characters of Mallory and Ryan. Mallory is a woman who lives at home and helps her mother after she is diagnosed with an illness. She works at the local hospital in the ER. She also has dreams that she has put on hold. Ryan is quite a mysterious character at first. He doesnt give a lot of information about what he is doing in Maine and when it is finally revealed it is quite a surprise. A connection between them forms and they find themselves falling for each other. There is another character that plays a large roll in this story and his name is Cole. Mallory and Cole have been good friends since they were teens and at one time they even dated. Cole is a character that I was not able to fully embrace like Mallory and Ryan. He is not a bad character just one that I felt sometimes had his own agenda and thought more of himself than others. There is a situation that happens in this story that causes Mallory to push Ryan away. She explains her reasons for doing so, however, I felt that she was just trying to convince herself that she was doing the right thing. Mallory finds herself with a chance to pursue a dream that she has. Will she take this opportunity? When it comes to love will she choose the man that others believe is right for her or will she choose the man that has stolen her heart? This is a book all about making choices. Do you follow what everyone else wants you to do or do you choose the way that will make you happy? This story had me frustrated at times however always hoping for a happy ending. I have read many books by this author and I have never been disappointed. I love her writing style. I know that when I sit down to read one of her books that I will get lost in a story that I will not soon forget.",This is an amazing story the I loved reading,2,9/21/2017

Of course they're right the timeline is all messed up. I was very much into the story and would buy the next bundle (the ones I read the review on) But there is no bundle, you can buy the books individually for entirely too much money for what they are. The story is  not worth the money to finish the series especially since I feel like $$$ is the only objective for the auther. I've already spent more than. I should have on this series.  Don't waist your money, I'll send my copies of books 1- 10  to anyone that wants them, if it's something my Kindle will do, otherwise I will simply delete them to free up the space.  Good storyline for the most part I just feel like Morgan Rice needs to realize that if you want loyal readers that she should be loyal to them also buy selling her books for the cost that they should be $1.99 or  $2.99 not $5.99.

Words are spelled wrong or used incorrectly.  Normally I'd let this slide on a cheap indie book but in spots it is so bad it simply takes you right out of the story.  The first book in this omnibus had a few problems.  The second had sections with two or three on a single page.  It was so bad that it gives the impression that the author couldn't be bothered to simply have a single person read the book before publishing.

The story features many evil challenges to conquer and quick and original thinking by the hero to save the day.  Supporting characters are very likeable and play key roles as they all encounter evil after evil.  If you like a story with lots of swordplay and last minute saves by the hero against ultimate evil, then this story is for you. Writing seemed a little rough at the beginning, but seemed to get better as the story moved along. I gave this four stars because the writing was a little weak at the beginning and because the typos were rampant throughout the story.  Some of these typos were significant enough that it made it more difficult to follow the story at best, and at worse, said just the opposite of what the writer intended.",Exciting story,2,6/13/2016

Our feckless heroine is spending the month of June in a condo in her home town of Veneto, Italy, while the professor-owner studies at USC. Mina sees it as a time to spend alone, visiting her beloved Nonna (grandmother)'s crypt, leaving flowers, and strolling the town and marveling over its changes. She is quickly befriended by Emilia, retired attorney and owner of the building,  a lady who always wanted to be a divorce attorney, but because divorce was for so long not a legal option in Italy, defended gypsies instead. Mina's heartache over the failures with Brian, and mourning over Diego, continually threaten to overwhelm her, but naturally whereever Mina is, danger and deaths quickly appear. She may be naive, but this young woman is never assured of a secure and peaceful life.","Love the Setting, Characters Well-Delineated",2,7/13/2016
2456,4,ACFLHDXCQZ01K,B00GF5XK0Q,"Coulson's Wife is a story that is unfamiliar to most people, that being just after the turn of the 20th century. Some of the subjects dealt with here (homosexuality, infidelity, subjugation of vows, etc) are looked upon much differently today than they were back then.

The basic premise is that a rich executive type wants a wife merely as a breeding vessel, to give him sons. He sees that as important to help form one's power base and to continue growing in the world of business. The wife chosen is not really told this ahead of time, so she becomes shocked, then disillusioned, by how she is treated by her husband. While such situations, even back then, were not commonplace, there was a portion of society who tended to treat a wife and family as only a status symbol. Boarding schools and womens' ""societies"" were ways for those ignored to deal with it.

Coulson is not a nice person. His disposition tends to ooze through the entire book, and bring things down. If you like ""Happily Ever After"" romances, or even happy romances in general, you will not get much satisfaction from this book. It's true that all the books in the series are stand-alone. Actually I first read ""Coulson's Secret"", which then got me to go back to the beginning. It may not be a bad idea, because much of the setup in the first book is the basis for the later stories. Reading a later story first helped me understand and maybe tolerate some of what went on in Book One.

The book is a fast read, and could be considered ""light"" literary fare, although it deals with some darker subjects. I am not a big romance reader, so I don't know how this story rates in the romance genre. However, it does bring you into the early 20th century society and carries you along. It is not for everyone, due to some of the subject matter. However, it can be an intriguing look into complicated human relationships. Personally I think it is well-done, and I will be reading more of the series, especially since I already started them ""out of order"", so to speak.","Unsettling And Not a Book to Uplift, But a Good Book For Human Interaction",2,2/9/2017

2463,4,A1Q1PDU91ND28H,B00GG0OZ9A,"Julia plans a surprise birthday party for her boyfriend in his dorm room with the help of his roommate.  Liam shows up thirty minutes late with his hand down a blonde's blouse.  He then proceeds to dump her in the most spectacular way.  Julia had dated Liam for ten months and even his Senator father liked her.  It was during finals of the fall semester of her junior year and the start of the new semester finds her still worrying the humiliation trying to move on.  She has driven her Psychology major roommate Ava batty.

This is where the book differs from where you would expect.  Julia settles on revenge, but she does not want to hurt Liam.  She wants him to learn empathy and understand how painful it is to the person you treat that way.  His roommate offers to help her get Liam back and she and Ava decide to take it a step further.  Fate steps in and she meets the brother of the boy she babysits for.  He is everything she wishes Liam was:  Caring, opens doors for her and really is into her.  She receives an assignment to take a personal experience and make lemonade out of the lemons life has handed her.  She is to blog about it.  She had politely shut down a girl in her class who had witnessed her humiliation, only to find the girl had a similar story so they set up social media to get other girl's stories.  They quickly change it to reflect guy's stories when a guy tells her what happened to him.

Julia is not malicious and that keeps this story fresh.  She doesn't just go to the next guy either.  She needs to understand how this happened and works on fixing herself first.  Giff is great as Liam's gay roommate.  He had been a great friend to both of them and he is funny and someone you want to hang with.  Jesse is the son from his first marriage of the Professor she babysits for part time.  His parent's divorce was very acrimonious.  He is there to get his Master's Degree in Speech Pathology so the tuition break and a free garage apartment work well.  He cannot win with his Mother and Sister who are both still bitter about the divorce.

Julia and Jesse are great characters because they work on their flaws, are honest with each other and learn from their mistakes.  They exhibit a level of maturity that is unusual in most books, not only NA novels.  Authors do not have to write down to a younger audience.  Good book, good characters and a fun read proves moving on is the best revenge.",Moving on is almost always the best revenge!,3,3/1/2016

She obviously is attracted to Derek and seems to not mind his manipulative way he first gets with her.  it is complicated with them but you do eventually get the idea that he had genuine feelings for her.

""With a no-nonsense approach and easy to follow directions, Janet Evans shares his experience (and recipes) for creating soaps from scratch safely and easily . Janet takes the reader step by step through the process of making natural soaps for family, friends, and for profit. Easy to understand and master.

Sounds good.

It starts off with the history of soap making. Terms are described, equipment needed, types of processing, a pretty extensive soaponification chart, marketing strategies and tips for soap business. Well, turns out it is NOT an easy undertaking, you can injure yourself with lye. And you need a kitchen scale as well as protective gear. I had trouble with the formula for lye despite example. I could only find one recipe (for olive oil soap). Definitely emphasis on safety. Shattered expectations, I am not going to even try, waaaaay too complicated.

Well, I can say that those who have more experience are going to get more enjoyment out of the book rather than those who have no experience at all. The author states ""with a no-nonsense approach and easy to follow directions."" Being a beginner who has ALWAYS wanted to try soap making for myself, this was not at all ""easy to follow"". I got confused quite a few times and had to re-read. Eventually I just looked up some stuff online to make sure I was actually doing things right. I did however, like the fact that the book included a history on soap making and a nice guide to safety like what to do and not to do and what all equipment you might need.

The book had a lot of marketing information for those who are interested in making soaps for craft shows, but in order to do that, one would need more information and recipies. There was one recipe included for ONE type of soap.

This book is getting 3 stars because
1. It does give you different types of oils vs lye amounts to use.
2. It does include one recipe which I assume you could dress up or down to your liking.
3. A good overview on the results of using different methods and outcomes.
4. Marketing information
5. History, Terminology and some basic information

The next chapter tells about the different materials you might need for making soap. This chapter was interesting to me because I didn't know what was needed to make it and didn't realize how much these ingredients will cost me. I was better educated about different soap making methods after reading this.

The last chapter is very useful if you are planning to make soap to sell. It talks about marketing strategies, and helps you decide what kind of ingredients you should use. I didn't care about this chapter because I want to make soap for the fun of it and for Christmas gifts, but I imagine this would be helpful to the person who wants to sell soap.

While I actually enjoyed the plot line and the main characters, it did feel like the author wrote a modern story and set it into the old west time period.  Kate is independent, runs her own ranch and has sworn off men.  Sam sees her and is almost instantly in love.  He sets out to get closer to her, but Kate had something traumatic in her past and doesn't want a relationship.
So there is mostly modern language in this story.  For example: ""Let's keep our relationship professional.""  I can't believe a woman in the 1860s would actually say that to a man.  There were some mildly steamy scenes that were enjoyable.

Furthermore, it was obvious that the pair, Sam and Kate, will come together at some point. I honestly didn't care if this is a clean romance or not (i.e. are there any sexy times), and there were several. My problem with this book is both characters are the kind that clam up when something should have been said, and instead, run away, leaving the other party to imagine the worst case scenario, i.e. ""s/he loves me not"" while denying the attraction with no appreciable reason! And this happens multiple times on both sides, as if they are just TOYING with each other, yet clearly what wasn't the intent of either character!  He kisses her all hot and bothered, then just walked away. She leaned in expecting a kiss, then quickly straightened and turned back into boss lady.  There were also elements that was supposed to show Kate is a strong girl such as ability to shoot but she never seems to carry a gun, even when she started to feel someone was watching her in the shadows, despite earlier scenes that show she was a good shot. The bad guy was just hanging around town looking for a chance to have her again? Sheesh. The earlier violence was not explained well either. All in all, a lot of ""flat"" evil that makes no sense, and a lot of UNintentional emotional cruelty against each other by the two main characters, esp. when she came back to town just to see if he's still available?

Then, he climbs aboard his horse, leaves town at night, and goes to her ranch, and watches her ranch house until well after midnight.  Creepy!!  At the least Sam is socially unaware but in my mind he is a sexual predator on the prowl and finding his victim in emotionally vulnerable Kate.

The daughter of a councilman, Noelle Cunningham, has lived a life of relative privilege, but longs for freedom from Eden's strict codes.

2477,4,A257TD5GO1T81W,B00GIA4GN8,"I really enjoyed these books. Not so much for the erotica, which gets to be too repetitive then winds you up and just stalls out on the follow through, which tends to be all emotion and in their heads instead of raw passion. Which is a shame because every scene starts very passionately. Of course, it was still overdone. I would say erotica overtook 3/4 of every story. That's too much, especially considering this author can actually write darn good drama and intrigue. That is by far my favorite parts of her stories. All the erotica scenes are bdsm and voyeurism. Even people who are innocent end up getting into group scenes or having tons of people watching them. It would be so much more sexy if each couple had their own preferences in the bedroom. While she might be trying to do that, every couple ends up morphing into every other one. Something exciting has been made boring by wearing it out.

My biggest complaint though is this author's lack of descriptions of the people. That drives me crazy. Makes it impossible to get a picture in my head, so I make one up, then 3/4 through a story she go especially us something, like they are black or have red hair and it completely throws off everything in my head. She is in desperate need of giving us a clear idea of what the characters terms look like. It's writing 101. You develop your characters to the point they are living and breathing on the page. We get none of that.

(Popular Culture and Philosophy)</a>&nbsp;before I had even heard of the Red Rising trilogy. I am addicted to the Pop Culture and Philosophy series, and the articles that looked at the issue of whether Darrow remained the same individual during his transformation or discussed the implications of a culture organized around occupation-based ""colors"" seemed interesting. So, purchased the first book as an audiobook and a digital book.

It is a captivating page-turner. The story begins with the teenage Darrow, a ""Red"" miner on Mars, working like the rest of his class to harvest helium-3, which will be used to transform Mars into a livable environment. Golds are at the top of the hierarchy. The first several chapters deal with Darrow's discovery of the corrupt treatment of his clan of Reds, who are defrauded into pushing themselves to the limit by promises of bonuses they will never receive. Darrow's beloved wife, Eo, is executed by the Gold Governor of Mars, which pushes Darrow into his own act of rebellion for which he is punished. Darrow is then sucked up into an underground revolutionary movement, the Sons of Ares, and is genetically redesigned into passing for a Gold.

Then, Darrow is admitted to the Institute, which separates the rulers of White society, a society that includes all the planets of the solar system.  The Institute turns out to be an anarchy where the students are again split up into ""houses"" based on personality types. Darrow is placed in the House of Mars, which is for the wrathful.

From here, we see the students murder, betray, plot, die, torture, maim and fight. Unlike a lot of other YA Dystopias, these are presented as real events; Gold's die. A nod is given to the concept that Gold culture is organized around evolutionary/eugenic principles and that these deaths are intended to promote the vigor of the Gold class. Maybe, but it does seem wasteful. The same concept shows up earlier in the book when Darrow displays an uncanny agility; the Reds are evolving, also.

In one passage, there was this exchange:

""He shrugs. Doesnt count for much.

So Ill give you facts, brotherman. This is the system. The lower Colors have their children by use of catalysts. Fast births, sometimes only five months of gestation before labor is induced. Except for the Obsidians, only we wait nine months to be born. Our mothers receive no catalysts, no sedatives, no nucleics. Have you asked yourself why? So the product can be pure.

And so that nature is given a chance to kill us. The Board of Quality Control is firmly convinced that 13.6213 percent of all Gold children should die before one year of age. Sometimes they make reality fit this number. He splays out his thin hands. Why? Because they believe civilization weakens natural selection. They do natures work so that we do not become a soft race. The Passage, it seems, is a continuation of that policy. Only we were the tools they used. Myvictimwas, bless his soul, a fool. He was from a family of no worth, and he had no wits, no intelligence, no ambition, he frowns at the words before sighing, he had nothing the Board values. There is a reason he was to die.

The ""13.6213 percent"" figure seems familiar.  I'm not sure if I read it in Mein Kampf or some work by an Amerian eugenicist.

Darrow performs brilliantly at the Institute, of course. He makes friends and enemies who will obviously be with him to the end of the trilogy. For example, the odd, oddly loyal and oddly deadly character of Sevro seems designed for the long haul. He also finds love in the form of Mustang, who, naturally, turns out to be the daughter of the Governor of Mars, and he finds an enemy in the Jackal, the son of the Governor of Mars. More importantly, Darrow discoveries principles that will enable him to bring about the revolution against the Gold society.

This story is a YA dystopia, and it seems to incorporate the tropes of this genre. Thus, we have teenagers on the verge of adulthood being sorted and trained for their future. We have the sorting into both classes, occupations and personality types. We have a testing to destruction of the teenagers, where to wash-out is to lose everything.

To me, though, it seemed to be more than a YA dystopia; it seemed like something of a throwback to pulp science fiction with an empire that spans the solar system and pulpy scientificish technostuff. I could almost feel the ghost of A.E. Van Vogt and Buck Rogers in the plot.

I enjoyed the audiobook where the narrator was able to present the Reds with a Scottish accent and the Golds with a plummy Brittish accent.

""Freedom costs too much.
But Eo disagreed.
Damn her.""

If you're a fan of war games and strategy then this is the book for you. Absolutely.
I was slow to start this series and skeptical of the hype but it kept popping up and I had a feeling it would be good and oh my word it was SO good.

This series revolves around such a cool concept and the world-building is simply spectacular. It truly is. Brown delivers enough detail spread throughout the story to fully immerse you in its setting without overwhelming or distracting from the action. And likewise he does not rely on action to produce a good story. There is depth and interest to be found in every scene, every choice, and every character thrust upon the page.

Overall it wasn't the fastest read for me (at least until the games really begin) but thats not because it was heavy-handed or dull. And although I read more slowly in the beginning, the idea had hooked me immediately and with every chapter I became more and more lost in time. The story picks up momentum with every crack and shatter in Darrows once-simple life, and when Darrow enters the Institute and takes aim at House Mars is when I really couldn't put it down!
But yeah, fantastic world-building, prime characters, excellent writing, and a bestselling idea. Just my opinion. I wait with cold delight for more.

RED RISING is a book of war games  cold logic, clever schemes, and unrelenting brutality in the name of power and passed down beliefs  from start to finish. Running with a tide of red that fills its harshness with love, freedom, and a dream worth everything, keep your eyes wary and your fears hidden as you witness just the first crack in an empires reign. All it takes is one well-placed blow.

""But never has Eo been more beautiful to me than in that moment. In the face of cold power, she is fire.""

As soon as Eo is introduced, I like her. She is strong, stubborn, and just a bit carefree. The way Darrow describes her is heartbreaking. He loves her. Darrow fears for her life. His fear and love combine to create something amazing in the chapters to follow.

""My life becomes agony.""

Never has this been more true. Darrow's life is the epitome of agony. This is something that seems to continue throughout the book. One trial after another, Darrow is challenged and pushed to his limit.

Sevro.

There aren't enough words to describe just how much I like this character. He comes in with a bang and continues to surprise and shock everyone throughout the story. He's snarky, smart, and unpredictable. He is quite the force.

Mustang.

I wasn't sure what to think of her at first. She was of an enemy camp. However, I found myself intrigued by her strength and compassion.

Pax.

Oh, the beast! He is huge. Literally. Huge. I am terrified by this character for his sheer size, but I also love the role he plays. The following sums up how I feel about Pax an Darrow feels it, too.

Overall, I obviously loved this book. This is the first time I have ever read a book by Pierce Brown and I can honestly say that I look forward to reading more of his work.

2484,5,A19RDMX22VXXSD,B00GIUG3ES,"Confession: When this first came out, I actually shunned it just because of all the buzz and hype because I am such a contrarian. The masses couldn't possibly be right, can they?  Yes, I was acting a little bit of a Gold. Plus the description just sounded like every other would be Hunger Games dystopian novel out there - derivative and ... a society stratified by colors, really?

And yet one day, four days ago to be exact, a copy happened to fall into my lap and upon reading the first page I was instantly, irrevocably HOOKED. I write this now having ripped through the entire trilogy in THREE DAYS.

Did I surreptitiously read it on my phone at work? YES. Did I battle exhaustion trying to read one more chapter into the late, late night despite loving sleep almost as much as chocolate? YES. Did I pounce on every vaguely bookish person I know and blather with the crazed look and incoherence of a fanatic about this novel, despite not even being a sci-fi reader? YES.

Don't be put off by the proliferation of all caps in my review. I haven't been this excited about a book in such a long time, plus I was in a bit of a reading slump, having been adrift in a sea of discarded books. So you must forgive me.

Okay, I will concede that the comparisons to Hunger Games and the Lord of the Flies have merit. Not only that, there are heavy Greek and Roman allusions. There are recognizable, familiar elements. This is after all a classic Hero's Journey. The lowly Darrow, motivated  by grief and revenge manages to rise to the highest strata - to even the realm of the gods.

It is not original and yet it is. Like Sevro and the Howlers and the rest of the House of Mars, I want to follow Darrow and see what next audacious step he takes. I was constantly surprised, on the edge of my seat trying to see how he would win or recover from a failure.

I'll admit there are problems. The female characters do not seem fully realized. There's a helluva lot of rape going on. But even with its flaws, Red Rising slayed me. I was all in from the first line to the last. I got the next book after a hundred pages in.

One thing I am thankful for, having come into this series rather late is that I had the entire trilogy at my disposal, reading one right after the other, without that agonizing long wait in between.

So far, Red Rising is probably #6 (out of 35) in my top reads of 2017.",Slayed me,2,7/17/2017
2485,3,A1AP8J5JHVUHJ0,B00GIUG3ES,"Actual rating 3.5 stars.

Ive owned Red Rising (well, the whole trilogy) for a while, but have only just started reading it after a number of rave book reviews popping up on my feed to remind me why I bought this collection in the first place. While an amazing story, at the beginning I was resistant to the narrative. There is a lot of information to process, and the writing style feels dry, or sparse, making it hard to connect with our protagonist, Darrow. Red Rising read like an institutionalised Lord of the Flies on a futuristic Mars. Brutal.

Darrow is a complex protagonist, but there is something hinted at in the narrative, at to how his destiny is shaped the way it is, but not revealed. I think this is a major part that stopped me from truly connecting with him. The novel is full of puppet masters pulling strings  and Darrow is ultimately just another pawn. I never felt his motivations and actions were truly his own. But I love an underdog story, someone fighting against insurmountable odds, so I was invested in his story though not truly convinced by his convictions.

The friendships formed  especially in the school, were barbarous and endearing. I see it in my best friend and his buddies that were in the S.A.S. together, there is a certain type of connection that is formed on the battlefield that nothing can break, and others will not truly understand. Piece Brown captured that comradery perfectly.

There are a few things about the society and its technology that puzzle me in the face of human nature. Such as the role carvers (doctors) play and how malleable the body, and its genetics can be. They are truly playing God and from the hierarchy and accounts of the ruling factions they pretty much are, but this aspect did not seem to be explored as far as I think it would be naturally with such a powerful instrument to play with.

The politics, however is an intricate web and blindsided me on a number of occasions. I think this, and the battle scenes are the best parts of the novel.

I may have rated Red Rising higher, because it is truly a tremendous tale, but if not for my issues connecting with the writing style, and near boredom through two thirds of the novel. But aside from that, it is a magnificent book that others may find outstanding. The writing style was sparse, dry, distinctly masculine. Even though the protagonist is male, something about the narrative made it difficult for me to immerse myself into the Martian landscape. I was frequently putting the book down for a rest or lack of interest. The last third of the novel, however, is an entirely different creature. The pacing is gripping, and so is the plot with all its twists and turns. The cast start to show their true colours and get tested I was truly riveted and could not put the book down. The only thing that kept my persistence in the beginning was that I had heard so many wonderful things from friends about this series and kept telling myself that it will get better any time now any time and finally it did.

I think there is so much to set up for this series to work, the world building, the motivations, the politics, that it takes some time to get its legs. That didn't bode well for this debut, but promises that the following two books in this trilogy should be amazing. Thats what I am hoping for anyway.

The main purpose of Red Rising is easily predictable  it has to be to continue on to the second and third in the series, but the journey there was not. There were some minor points that I had been spoiled from my friends, but they confirmed what I thought as I was reading, but did not detract from the enjoyment near the end. I still got shocked and horrified. Its a great story, but because of the issues I had with the writing style, did not get emotionally invested. Had I been sucked in, I think Red Rising would have brought all the feels.

On a side note, I found elements of this society synonymous to that of the Japanese yaoi Ai No Kusabi (minus the sexual nature of the anime.) This book has also been optioned to be turned into a movie. Id be interested to see how this series will be treated maybe it will fix the issues of pacing because there wouldnt be the need for pages and pages of explanations. And I can just imagine the special effects! No news has come through on the development of this project as yet, but I am certainly keeping my eyes peeled. Additionally, Pierce Brown is starting a new series in this universe, with the first novel Iron Gold due for release in January 2018. Its all so exciting!

It was pretty fantastic. 15% in I was googling to find out when the movie would come out. I was disappointed to discover it might be awhile. Somebody please cast Alexander Ludwig as Darrow. I don't care that he played Cato in The Hunger Games and might draw even more comparisons between the two books/movies/whatever. He plays Bjorne Ironsides now and has a young face and would make a fantastic golden boy.

The factions of this book are wonderfully gray. It's easy to forget who is friend or foe. The Sons of Ares are freedom fighters. An underground railroad of sorts. They are also terrorists. The Gold caste are vain, proud, oppressors. But some are also kind, gentle and loyal. Now- would those few be so kind and gentle to the low born Reds? Maybe not. You don't see much interaction between those Gold that could be considered kind and the lower castes. You see them culled. (Perhaps not all of them- but still most of the interactions in the book do not feature the Reds, only Golds.)

The storytelling is fantastic. You see Darrow fall only to rise again several times. You see him betrayed. You see him elevated and celebrated by those who love him. The twists are good. Some of them you may see coming, but some of them you won't. I don't really want to get into the story any more than that for fear of giving something away.

I only gave it four stars because the author is almost too talented a writer for his own good. The writing often reads like poetry.

The beginning is grim, sad, shows you the hardship of living as a slave. The main character rises from all that and is given a chance to vengeance, to live among those responsible for the pain of his people and crush them from within.
Naturally, when he gets to know them better, he understands this battle is not as black and white as he hoped and that this vengeance will cost him greatly.
And so does the reader gets a glimpse of the darkness that lies ahead.

The first book plays more like a fantasy than a sci-fi. Not much technology, not much science talk. It all comes down to a sword and shield, whether they are made from metal or some fancy energy field. The author doesn't waste time explaining how space flight works, or how terraforming a planet is carried away. If there's an energy armor around a guy that stops projectiles from hitting him, the only thing you need to know is that he'll bloody kick your sorry ass.

The books are carried from a single POV, no side characters breaking the flow, no site stories to distract you from the main plot. And I loved them for it.

2490,2,A2X4AEWNWCA1NX,B00GIUG3ES,"Red Rising, and its two sequels in the trilogy of the same name, have been hailed as the equal of the Hunger Games Trilogy. The series hero, Darrow, has been likened to Ender Wiggin of Orson Scott Cards classic four-book science fiction series as well as Katniss Everdeen of the Hunger Games. I suspect the likeness is not accidental. If you concoct a Heros Journey along the lines Joseph Campbell described, sketch out a fearless teenage protagonist, and throw in a smattering of love interest, chances are good youll gain a following not just among the 14-year-old boys who are the core readers of science fiction but older readers of both sexes as well. If you write reasonably well, as Pierce Brown does, youve got a shot at a best-selling series. In any case, whether the resemblance is or is not accidental, Mr. Brown scored with this one.

In Red Rising, 16-year-old Darrow is devastated when the ruler of the planet Mars executes his beloved wife. (Yes, they're all human.) Inspired by her bravery, Darrow sets out to lead a revolution to free not just his fellow Reds on Mars but the people of other low-Color castes in human settlements throughout the Solar System. The story is set many hundreds of years in the future, probably the 29th or 30th century, and humanity has been forced into a brutal caste system ruled over by the wealthy and powerful Golds. Reds work the mines underground. Pinks are prostitutes of both sexes. Obsidians are fearful soldiers and guardians of the realm. And so forth. To take down this evil system, Darrow must first pass a series of life-threatening tasks and gain an apprenticeship with one of the leading Gold families. From that high perch, he can gain the power he needs to lead the revolution. Does this all sound a little like Ulysses or Jason and the Golden Fleece? Of course! Darrows unsteady progress toward his goal is the subject of this, the first volume of Browns trilogy.

If the author had demonstrated more creativity in naming and describing his characters, as Suzanne Collins did in The Hunger Games, Red Rising might have been more entertaining. Unfortunately, Brown based most of his characters on the Roman gods who lived on Mount Olympus and descended to meddle in human affairs from time to time. With characters named Apollo, Jupiter, Minerva, Juno, Venus, Diana, Ceres, Vulcan, and Mercury, Red Rising eventually becomes tedious indeed, especially when they are literally (and repeatedly) referred to as gods.

Maybe because the protagonist is a low-born sort but it's slightly better than ""Me Tarzan. You Jane. Ugh.""  Plotwise it reminds me of a cross between Harry Potter and a reverse-Gladiator with some other tropes thrown in that I can't quite place [maybe the Hunger Games except I'm too old to have read that].  Anyway so far it just moves right along from one thing to the next and I don't care about any of it.  Between the simplistic, linear plotting, and the plodding writing, it really feels like what they used to call a ""juvenile"" sci-fi (maybe today they call it ""young adult"") except a bit heavy on the old ultra-violence for the kiddies.  And I'm looking at this, saying I've got 2/3 of this left to go, plus 2 more novels in the series, which means I'm really only 1/9 of the way through it, and I'm about done.

I cannot say exactly that this book is wholly original either. I recognize many other books influence through the pages of Red Rising. Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies also come to mind. Yet it still feels fresh. Most important is how strong of a Main character Darrow is. He is the voice of the book. He is a very proactive protagonist.

This has some elements of YA to it but I never felt as if I was reading a YA novel. It all feels very mature in a way that things like the Hunger Games just didn't to me. So if YA isn't you thing don't worry.

My biggest compliant I have is there are a lot of side characters. I found it difficult to keep track of them all. Usually in first person books there is less side characters to keep track of. Since we never get a POV from them they can be forgettable. To many times he would be talking to a character and I would be at a loss for who they were exactly.

Beyond that, I was hoping for a decent science fiction story. I'm not entirely sure I got that, as the ""science"" was pretty fantastical, but it was an entertaining adventure story, albeit with many of the dystopian tropes that infest YA novels.

Our hero, Darrow, is part of a mining crew on Mars. In good dystopian fashion, his people are purposely kept in the dark as to the true nature of their society, and they're essentially used as slaves by the powerful and privileged. An awful injustice leaves Darrow seriously pissed off at the world and so starts his quest for revenge by any means possible.

I think of ""Red Rising"" as a sort of male PoV version of ""The Hunger Games"". Instead of television entertainment, characters are subjected to war games to help establish them within the hierarchy of society. It turns out to be a great deal more deadly than the participants initially realize.

Of course, most of the adults are either ineffectual or downright foul. To be fair, though, most of the teens are pretty nasty too. When things start getting desperate during the war exercises, the veneer of civilization quickly sloughs away. The participants engage in some awful practices in order to win and establish themselves as leaders. Despite his desire for vengeance, Darrow proves to be more civil than those supposedly born to polite society. I found him more likable than I'd initially expected.

Once he learns the truth he joins the rebels to infiltrate the Mars elite Golds to free his enslaved people. This requires more than Darrow could imagine and it might mean he must turn himself into one of them.

Darrows life is hard. All the Reds struggle and toil in the mines for this ideal life one day on the surface. Darrows whole world is his dangerous job and the love he has for his wife. He is only 16, but well into his prime in this society. The gloves come off when we follow Darrow above the surface to see the truth. Darrow undergoes so much change in this book, both mentally and physically. The story shifts from the beginning of a revolution, to one boys fight to keep himself alive.

This book is unlike anything I have ever read. It has fantastic world building. In the first few chapters we get a good look at how the Reds live. The we see other parts of Mars and get a breakdown of the colors. This world uses literal colors to keep people apart and it creates this clamoring for power within the colors. Everyone wishes they were Gold, but you cant change how you were born, or can you?  I loved learning the slang of each color and the even the clothing of each color is well described. All of this is done brilliantly and without boring info dumps. I cant imagine the author trying to break this world/societies down for the reader. I won't even try to sum it up in my little review. Just know that this book is something not to be missed if you enjoy great world building.

Something else about this story that blew me away is that it takes several turns I didn't see coming. Not twists per se, but for Darrow the rules, and even the game itself, is ever evolving. There is a lot of heartbreak and carnage in this story but it is beautifully done. I loved all the courage in these characters and the friendships tore my heart out. This is a fantastic YA dystopian. I cant wait to read the next book!",Amazing!,12,2/27/2016

This is my first introduction to Nicole Burnham's books and I have to say that I am happy that I found her.  I loved this book... and it has some hot passionate romance too!

Prince Stefano Barali was young and volunteered for the summer.  And, so did Megan Hallberg.  They had a hot passionate summer and then they parted ways.  Weeks later when Megan found evidence of her tryst with Stefano.  Megah tried to reach him to let him know, but as it turns out, Stefano didn't receive them and his family railroaded him into getting engaged to a princess.

Stefano never stopped thinking about Megan, (but he never once tried to find her and with all his money and resources--so if the author wants us to believe this story, she needs to think about what a real prince would do). After Megan found out that he had a fiance she stopped trying.  Ten years later, they meet again and boy is Stefano in for a surprise and he is very angry that he has lost 10 years with his daughter.  Will Stefano and Megan get a second chance?  Not if Megan feels that the only wants to marry her because of their daughter.",A Second Chance with a Prince and a lost love.,2,8/16/2016

2504,3,A3H1YPKLPLWALL,B00GIZYMVY,"This story was sweet but a little frustrating. The Prince was on a military assignment for a good will trip. He met Megan a 21 or 22 year-old college student on a good will trip also. They met and had a great time and left on a good note and thinking they were to never see each other again. Months later Megan finds herself pregnant with his child. She tried reaching him to let him know with no luck. Then she found out he was engaged a month after their time together. She decided to keep her child a secret from him and raise her on her own.

Fast forward 10 years later and they meet again at a grand re opening to this 5 star hotel in Barcelona that she works for as a director. He sees her and wants her all over again. This time he wants more from her because he could not stop thinking about her. Megan tries to stay a way from him so he won't find out about their 10 year old child. Megan finally gets cornered by the Prince and she tells him but ask that they could talk about why she never told him.
Of course, the Prince wants to get to know his daughter and he does in secret. He falls in love with his daughter and Megan also. And proposes to her using practical ways why they should be married. Megan doesn't want practical, she wants love when she decides to marry anyone.
This story goes around in circles a little bit. I like how they talk to each other and express their feelings towards everything but actually saying the word love. They both are waiting on the other person to say it first before she would even agree to marry him.

I thought the way they resolved the misunderstanding of why Stefano didn't know about Anna was very well written. There was no revenge, threats, or any other form of retribution from him and that was wonderful. In fact he immediately wanted a family and marriage. The only thing that I saw as a flaw was the relationship between him and Anna. They spent months visiting and towards the end when she's critically ill they are all more worried about the press. I would have like for the King and queen too acknowledge the little girl and to see her call Stefano dad.

I will openly admit I had no interest in the man. He wasn't even a blip on my radar after I read Fate. I wanted to skip him and I did. I jumped into the 5th Street series and now; here I am to shout to the world that EVERY romance book fan must meet, taste, and devour SERGEANT BILLINGS!

Holy mother of intense books, this story is one that demands attention. Brandon Billings go the short straw in life and honestly made the best of whatever situation he found himself in. We saw that what happened to him and Sofie Moreno, and what condition his dad was in when we last saw him. Did we think his situation could get any worse? No. Did it? Heck yes.

""What's past is prologue"". Yes, yest it is and Brandon is proof of that. He gets a taste of that quote a few times in his life. The dark haired beauty at the airport with the complicated food order is one. She is a reminder of his past, a past he has come to accept and understand, a past that was not meant to be. Then FATE steps in and that dark haired beauty keeps make and appearance, how does this happen? FATE!! You can't escape it, you can only accept it.

Regina, goodness I love her, demons and all. I effing adore this chick!! Every moment with Brandon was simply what it was suppose to be, real. They had me wrapped around their fingers and eating out of their hands. They truly are one of the sweetest, most sensual, and real couples that are brought together by events they have absolutely no control over.

I tip my hat to Mrs. Reyes, the way she meshes and blends these characters from one story to the next is absolute magic! Seamless, perfection, flawless. We get to visit some of the Moreno's and other characters from that series. I, of course, am biased when it comes to Romero, Manny and Max and will say now that every scene they were in was AWESOME!!

The book has some spectacular suspenseful parts and they had me white knuckling my reader and had me at the edge of my seat. I loved those heart pounding moments and had to go back and re-read them s l o w l y for added effect. The book was truly what a beautiful true love story is supposed to be (in my opinion).

The ending was simply perfect. What FATE brings together don't even attempt to fight. You will never survive.

Iis impossible to read it and not think of Cherryhs Foreigner series. The diplomat with the love interest back home, the very dangerous intersection of cultures that are alike but not alike, the alienation of the main character from his home culture, as well as the mental self doubt and the pacing of the action are very reminiscent. So is the presence of the main characters Security and their fascination with electronics. Did I mention that they are obsidian and very tall? Perhaps inter species diplomacy is a new sub genre spawned by Foreignor?  Cherryh is one of the giants of science fiction and fantasy so to speak of this book in the same breath is a compliment, not a criticism. It reads like some of the earlier books in the series in its emphasis on the different way different cultures react to the same stimuli but it seems rushed to get where Cherryh was in the later books. It also defaults the main character, Cory Wilsons, culture to mid  Victorian England which I found annoying, but not annoying enough to make me stop reading.",Reminds one very strongly of C J Cherryhs Foreignor. Not as good but not bad.,3,11/4/2017
2511,5,A3MS6ZSD15S6PL,B00GL27J46,"Originally posted on Tales to Tide You Over

Seeing Red is one of my story sweet spots, in part because I grew up in the diplomatic community like Cory Wilson did, except that my exposure was to many Earth-based cultures as opposed to those from other planets. Not everyone can swing that community, but Patty Jansen does a wonderful job not just of the atmosphere but the attitude such an upbringing encourages.

In case my intro didn't make it clear, I really enjoyed this story, and look forward to reading more in the series. Dont let my comments about diplomats fool you, though. This is an action-packed story where whole worlds hang in the balance, theres a deadly conspiracy, and you're never quite sure where the dominant loyalty is or should be.

The book starts by throwing you into a strange situation with strange people behaving strangely. While I appreciated how explanations were smoothly tucked in when reasonable, I was still disoriented because of the lack of grounding at first, in part because I hadnt read the blurb so came to the book completely ignorant. However, the feeling didn't last, and as the complexity of the situation became clear, I was able to see how any attempt at grounding from the start would have been a data dump that confused more than helped. Im mentioning this only because the payoff for that disorientation is most definitely worth the effort unless, of course, you're the type of reader who isn't bothered by the mad rush beginnings where you have to accept everything on the assumption itll be clear later, which it was.

As that picture came together, though, Seeing Red had all the cultural conflict and complexity I could have hoped for. The impact of history, personalities, and decisions is very much a living element of the story, even when the characters (and readers) are unaware just what is driving some of the events. This series is founded on the idea of a humanoid diaspora where every different race is related somewhere in the distant past, but their environments and cultures have developed in divergent paths to the point that they don't always understand what each other means.

There are little details to emphasize the alien nature of the situation, like Corys bodyguards being nameless as part of their culture. Each time he identifies them by hair color, wearing sunglasses, or some other detail it offers a subtle reminder that were in alien territory.

Then theres the social structure of the gamra which is based on interweaving, often contradictory, ties of loyalty. It means Cory has difficultly knowing who is pulling the strings of those around him and where their first loyalty lies. This opens the story to neat conflicts in loyalty, logic, and manipulation, again adding to the complexity and making the truth Cory is trying to uncover even more difficult. Theres also good seeding of the details as things come back into play and turn out to be even more complex than they appeared at first.

There was a little repetition in the descriptions at times, but really, that was the only weakness I noticed in a lovely story that demonstrates the power of diplomacy, the influence of growing up in a truly international community, and how success comes through being willing to adapt and yet stand firm when necessary.

In summary since Ive gone on long enough, Seeing Red offers a detailed, twisted tale full of mysteries to uncover and what seems to be the issue often isnt. Once the facts are available, though, the seeding is there to support it. The beginning might have been a sink or swim toss into a complicated situation without the knowledge to understand what was happening, but it didn't last long before I started being able to figure things out, and it certainly added to the urgency, and difficulties, with which everything comes about. I like how the global problem is recognized as a symptom and something to address rather than a fluke, while the complex balance between cultures with very different values is fascinating. I thoroughly enjoyed this one.",Alien Diplomacy Is Much More Than a Desk Job,2,6/13/2017

I was a little confused at times, the style is at times a bit short when it comes to tracking stuff in the story. But I very much enjoyed reading the book.

>I am an independent reviewer. This book is the 1st in the Carlswick Mysteries. The mystery is wrapped up, but the relationships are just beginning. Stephanie is a New Zealander going to England. Her father and grandmother live there. Stephanie meets James on the train to Carlswick where she is going to stay with her grandmother before her term at Oxford. Stephanie is a history buff and the amount of research the author puts in to the story is really incredible. The mystery is woven amongst the true mysteries of hidden and stolen artwork during the Nazi period.

>Stephanie and James are attracted to each other but an old feud between their families cause them to distrust each other. James' brother, Alex, is abusive and evil. He is involved in the mystery, along with Stephanie's deceased aunt and grandma.

>The chemistry between James and Stephanie is so obvious, but they go back and forth between hating each other and falling for each other that the story stays super G rated. I would have liked more of a backstory on James' ex, Victoria. She does not seem like anyone he would ever be with. The mystery is revealed at a perfect pace, teasing the reader as we find out clues right along with Stephanie, her cousin, Matt, and childhood friend, Michael.

I was struck silent for the depth and beauty I found in these three books in the ""Song of Submission"" series. You may ask yourself how could any erotic romance centering itself around the discovery, delights, trials, personal recriminations, societal judgement and reactions from friends and family of a bdsm relationship have depth of thought, artistic vision and literary merit?  Well that's just exactly what is found in these beautiful writings of CD Reiss.
What's more you can enjoy these books purely because they are well written, exciting, jaw droppingly, panty meltingly HAWT!!!  The romantic tension and suspense will keep any lover of erotic romance  warm with engines purring, even if, bdsm is far from your normal.  You cannot help but appreciate its art responsibly practiced by Jonathan and Monica...the ""play"", exchange of power, is some  ""heady"" uber sexy reading.
Beyond the ""feels"" you experience, is the exquisite enfolding of themes, references to art and literature and the artistry of the language used by the author.
Music is heard in the words, phrasing and pacing. References and allusions are made to musical works and instruments throughout the prose. The works themselves are like ""tone poems"" or a 21st century version of variations on a  musical theme.
In ""Control"", Jonathan shows himself to be a master of control. He is Monica's "" King"" in control of everything and most importantly, in control of himself. He uses this iron- willed control to get what he wants.
 Monica is feeling more and more out of control. She sees that her newly-found kink is bleeding into her career. She feels a taint and judgement from many corners of her life. She is afraid of losing control of her driving desire for a successful music career as she indulges in her high-wire act of a sex life.
She is impossibly attracted to Jonathan...no it's more than that, she is in love with him body, emotions, mind and soul. She just can not reconcile her new ""kinkier"" identity, the need to deny it publicly and the one driving force sacred to her throughout her life so far, music.

""Burn"" reads like a dance that leaves you breathless.

This, I want. Ive never wanted anything so badly. I feel your hands on your phone when you read my texts. I go to the Stock after your shifts just to stand where youve stood. I fall asleep on the pillow you used when you were in my bed. I need to share whatever piece of the world you're in. Tell me you don't feel the same. - Jonathan

God bless you if ever you heard those moving words of love, heat and attraction from your man or lover. Truly swoon-worthy.  Throughout most of this book, the words placed in the mouth of Jonathan read like a song of want, need and, yes love.  She is the ""sea"" to his ""sky"".  Throughout these books, the descriptions of the sky are original with qualities of strange beauty.

""I watched the sky go from navy to royal, to cyan, to baby boy blue."" - Monica

In this passage, Monica describes the sleepless night she spent because of the ""burn"" of her want of Jonathan. The writing is often cinematic like it is in this passage.  Actually they both ""burn"" for each other.  I promise that you as the reader will be burning up as well, for many reasons after reading this  ""stanza"" in the ""Songs of Submission"" work.

""Resist"" is a suspense-filled book that describes the manipulative  machinations of Jonathan's ex-wife to at best, bribe and at her worst, ruin Jonathan's life and world.  The story becomes ever more complex with revelations from and about Jonathan.  While Monica and Jonathan are resisting outside forces set in motion to destroy their relationship, they also offer resistance to each other, bristling at each other's display of willfulness.
Just when they find their hot and sexy stride again, Ms. Reiss leaves you with your heart in your throat at the end.
Fortunately, I found this series when the books were all released and packaged for sale in three sequences.  I don't think I could have stayed sane waiting for the next book. I have been entertained and inspired hours on end. I fell in love with the characters' ""love affair""...these characters will be part of my literary memory for a lifetime.  The value of this enrichment of my life is beyond price.

2546,5,A37Q72JZAVYCGK,B00GPSVRZS,"The story of a boss, Doug, and his subordinate, Sara, who turns into his submissive, is not unique.  What makes this book so worth reading is the way the characters are developed.  Sara first has to grapple with her desire to stay home but she decides to get her feet wet in the BDSM community.  She is then approached by a co-worker who has seen her perform and they start a relationship.  The boundaries of this relationship are always being tested, especially when Doug is forced to lay off the whole department that Sara used to work with.

If you are a fan of character development and tight writing, then this book is for you.

2547,5,A2Z38JNQ0IAPYH,B00GPULOIG,"Review: Pope Francis by Michael J. Ruszala.

Who is Jorge Bergoglio? This is a well written book about the 266th Bishop of Rome who is now Pope Francis. Its a very trustworthy account of Gorge Bergoglios growing up years and the many acts of kindness, events, as he walked the path to his place as Pope Francis. He is a man who lived amongst the poor and forgotten. I have not met Pope Francis but after reading this book I feel I know him. He sounds like hes an outstanding person and he claims his key to everything is, Mercy.

His life began in Buenos Aires, Argentina and born to a family of Italian Immigrants who escaped Italy from the Mussolinis fascist regime. Pope Francis is the eldest of five siblings. He saw and learned from an early age the inconsistently between the poor and rich that would later encompass his thoughts, behavior and actions he displays over the years. He has already proven to us that luxuries are not on his agenda. He just opens his heart and walks amongst people letting them know that they are not forgotten and they are loved

The message he engages is for people to know who they are, where their hearts could be, and what they could do for others. His credence is assisting with humility and rejecting the specialties Popes are given today. He entered the priesthood at the age of seventeen; he spent some years teaching philosophy, theology among other subjects and followed the path of his faith. He is now seventy-six and I hope he has many more years.

The way the world is now Pope Francis has many issues that we place in front of him and I feel he isn't going to shy away or back down. Hes going to face the issues of abortion, same sex marriage, and women being ordained Priest, amongst other issues as the Catholic scandal and pray to bring peoples faith and beliefs back to the church..

Pope Francis only wants us to say a prayer for him  2014

2548,4,A16ZTSR8M5J5G2,B00GQAMBV4,"I read this in an afternoon.  It's not that long, and it's one of those books where I felt like I was racing through it to see what would happen next.  The book jumps into action right off and it doesn't let up until it's over.  There's a lot of sailing lingo that flew right over my head, but it wasn't so much that I couldn't follow.

Once the villains show up the book gets brutal.  Really brutal.  But it isn't just the bad guys.  Kelly realizes she's the one who has to be the hero if there's any chance of making it through their ordeal alive.  And her brutality is on par with the bad guys.  Hers just seems justified.

One of the things I do find frustrating about Alex's story, is the groups continued safe guarding of their secrets and not sharing to better the general population.

2557,4,A112JRLN4F6ZYQ,B00GQQPU4I,"Rating this book was difficult. The story is excellent. The plot and the characters are compelling. The basic writing style works very well, although the jumps back and forth in time in the first book made following the storyline very difficult at times. The story just grabs you and you want to know what happens next. For four nights, I didn't get much sleep, because I kept thinking ""just one more chapter."" However, the editing of the book is horrendous. It is as if the author wrote a few chapters, stopped for a month, and then started writing more chapters without bothering to read the previous chapters over to pick up where he left off. The is no continuity from chapter to chapter, sometimes from paragraph to paragraph or, in one case, sentence to sentence. There was one critical point where I almost stopped reading the book, when a man nearly gets the protagonist, Will, nearly killed. He incites a mob, in part, by referring to a fact few, if any, of the people present should know. Instead the author writes the scene as if the piece of information is common knowledge. It infuriated me, because, in addition, Will does not exhibit, even mentally, any surprise or curiosity as to how this guy knows the fact. There are other types of editing errors as well. For example, Will is thrown into a room in a primitive dwelling and the door is slammed shut with a guard outside. Will then turns around, speaks to the guard, and draws a curtain so the guard can't see him. What? Another example is when, in the middle of the book, the author summarizes what happened just a few chapters earlier in the same book. It truly feels like no editor, or even the author, read the first three books through to insure continuity, consistency, and proper construction of the books. It was very, very annoying given that it happened so frequently. While typos were not frequent enough to be distracting, some of the errors made sentences unintelligible. Of course, that may be a Kindle problem. Despite all that, however, the story sucks the reader in and makes the people and events matter. The excellence of the story is why this review has four stars instead of three.

This is a brief but enjoyable story that follows a businessman as he travels on a train through England. Unfortunately, that train has acquired some nasty passengers. This is one trip Saunders may not survive.

Well written and very grim, this short played out as a twist on the classic Red Riding Hood for me. Although, I am not sure that was ever intended. It is simply how my mind chose to wrap around this tale of wolves and morals. A tense and clever read that I appreciate not only for the entertainment value, but the authors ability to address commercialism in such a small amount of time.

Also to me the plot is a little over the top that a girl in hiding is now going to choreograph the onstage dances for a super star and has asked to be one of the dancers.

Imagine a situation where a HUGE pop star meets a dancer during a weekend wedding event and asks her to choreograph her tour!!  Apparently no experience is required.  Ha!

Add to this the whole WITSEC fiasco, a dog who can jump a 10 foot fence and the most ridiculous demise of a bad guy.  Hence the eye-rolling warning.

The book is filled with adults who act like twelve year olds complete with high-fiving at the dinner table.
I don't think we are quite at the family dinner stage, Mom.  What stage are you at then, bro? Jake asked as he stuffed a large piece of garlic bread in his mouth.  The M.Y.O.B. stage, Eric replied.  Ohhh burned, Nikki said.""  BURNED???  These people are around 30!!!

Id rather be a daddys girl than a mommas boy! Nikki pushed her brother. (34 year old brother ...)  Sigh.

""Even his parents, who had only met her briefly, had called him three times this afternoon to grill him about his and Lilys relationship status.""  Three times in one afternoon?  Why make the behavior so exaggerated?  When your favorite character in a romance book is the dog you know there are problems.

Why we needed to know that Eric's father had to have an immediate  bowel movement at the end of every meal makes no sense.  This is a other who loves to describe physical issues.  There are multiple references to Lily's hands shaking, especially when she is about to have an orgasm.  What????

There is so much extraneous information it is mind-boggling.  ""During her all-access stint she had also seen Lost in Translation, Finding Nemo, Kill Bill, Elf, Mona Lisa Smile, Underworld, Peter Pan, X2, and Old School, all at least ten times each.""  How about four pages devoted to meeting the dogs and multiple pages about handwarmers?  Sadly, we even get the lyrics to the ""Hokey Pokey"".  That was definitely a literary first, and I hope, last.

My biggest issue is the assumption that romance readers are dummies.  EVERYTHING is painstakingly explained.

""Too bad she knew she wasn't Carlos type because she didn't have a penis.""  We get it.  Carlos is gay.

""She figured that someone with Karinas status was used to people saying yes. In fact, she was pretty certain that there was even a name for that. They called them yes people."" Wow! Really?  What a catchy phrase!

We're even so stupid we need a ""house of cards"" reference explained.  ""But he knew that if he did that it would be like flicking a card at the bottom of a card housewhich Nikki used to do all the time when he was a kid! In the blink of an eye, the entire structure would collapse.""  Oh, NOW I get it!

Honestly, if you've stopped reading Archie comics, you might be too old for this book.  On the bright side, there are no major editing gaffs and the hero knows what a condom is.

Writing this at the half-way point in the story, I have three major complaints.  In ASCENDING order of annoyance:
1) The heroine's seeming inability to recognize a man in a mask who she can otherwise describe in detail having been in love with him previously.
2) Her willingness to let said man, a supposed 'stranger,' take extreme personal liberties with her after only one previous meeting. This happened so early in the story that it felt unnatural to the point of being nearly offensive.  I don't have a problem with sex between the H/h, but this was, IMHO, way to early and not in keeping with the manners and mores of the era.
3) The heroine's dogged clinging to the idea that he must be punished for ruining her family even in the face of evidence to the contrary.

So when her brother was kidnapped and sent to America, Madalyn followed by stowing away on the next ship out.

At first she vehemently screams know as her heart doesn't want to go through a media circus as she did the first and only time that her abilities led to finding a little boy.  She was treated as a freak.
In the next book she meets another psychic who has a thing for her. He tried to break her up with Jared, the detective who left his girlfriend and had fallen deeply in love. I don't want to give away the whole story so will say she gets stabbed and her mom gets kidnapped and put in the trunk of the man who did it. Her and the other psychic Declan become friends and business partners. Her dad becomes a suspect and together Jared and Kate defy fate to bring this eternal love story together. You may shed a few tears, laugh and feel like you want the kind of love they have.
I recommend that if you only read 3 books a year get this series.

While my favorite books in her paranormal world are the Recipe for Death books, the King Series and the Serendipity Duet run right up there with them.  While all of the sets are stand alone, to me it is important to read them all to understand all the connections that are made across them all.  I did not read them in order.  The King Series was actually the last series within this world that I read even though they actually came first.  Once I read them, so many dots were connected.  I was nice to go back and meet characters that I had only had brief glimpses of previously.  I highly recommend reading them all.  If you haven't read any of them yet, I suggest reading them in order so you can start from the beginning.  I wish I would have realized just how connected they all are even though they are stand alone.

2575,4,A3BLT4A2WSSK6M,B00GSE3VPI,"This collection contains the novels Playing God,Reclamation,The Quiet Invasion,and Fool's War.  I was intrigued by the sample of Fool's War I read and decided to take a chance on this collection for price reasons($6.15/one novel vs. $11.33/four novels).
Fool's War:set in a future a few hundred years after a bitter religious war where muslim's came out on the losing side in a civilization where artificial intelligence is necessary to handle society's technical complexity and in trade off occasionally rogue AI's awakening to sentience wreak major havoc.  Humanity has spread to to many worlds in a diverse but stressful flowering where our main protagonist is the owner of a trading vessel who happens to be female,muslim,intelligent,and highly driven.  The novel opens as the vessel takes on a new crew member that is a Fool,a highly trained equivalent of a court jester from ancient times whose function is to help relieve the stresses and tensions that can come to head on the long interstellar voyages inherent in the life of a trade vessel. A weird premise for sure but Zettel's writing quickly won me over.  She built a world of sympathetic,complex characters facing extreme challenges in unsettling times that connected deeply with me.  The ending was well done,heart rending but hopeful.  Occasional minor editing errors fail to mar a work by an writer that has earned her place as one of the authors I follow.
If I read more of the remaining three stories I will update.  Recommended.","Refreshing change of pace from same old, same old",8,10/10/2016

2578,2,A8C6DZFGLGGQI,B00GT4I4L8,"I was reading along, enjoying the story, noting some problems in grammar and usage (but not spelling, oddly), until I got to 54%.  The h and her twin brother had gotten embroiled in a murder and were in hiding.  Their guardian showed up to help them out, and had the predictable reaction to the h's great beauty.  It was mentioned several times that his guardianship would be over within a matter of months, with the twins' 21st birthday.  He and the h (sorry, I've forgotten their names) flirt some, and then they exchanged some smoldering kisses.  This seemed kind of unethical on the part of the guardian, but I kept reading.  Suddenly, though, at 54%, he's undressed both of them and they are ready to go at it.  That was when I stopped reading.

I know a lot of people don't like people reviewing books they haven't finished, and I've even finished books I didn't like much just to be able to write a review.  But this development sickened me, and I couldn't go further.  We all know what to call men who have sex with younger women who are beholden to them for finances: molesters.  This guardian had no more ethics than a boss who could fire an employee if she didn't have sex with him.  Yes, she wanted what was happening, but that has nothing to do with anything.  An ethical guardian would have put her aside gently but firmly, telling her that after her birthday he would apply to her brother for permission to court her, but that until then, they couldn't see each other in this way.  No amount of pouting or throwing herself at him should have shaken his resolve to be an honorable gentleman and guardian.

2579,3,A1CY5H124AHZGP,B00GT84JJU,"I love the chemistry between Sabrina and Luke. Their story alone would have made this a 5-star.  And wow, their love scenes? Mmmm very well written. I had to go bug my husband after reading them. They felt real and were extremely well written. To me, these two characters felt real, their dialogue was believable, and I liked them together.

However I have some issues:
* Multiple POV's. And I don't mean just Main Guy & Main Girl. I mean several other non-main characters. ugh.

  -- Why do I need Ben's point of view? First of all, he's not at all believable. If he truly wanted to propose to Sabrina to push Luke into admitting his feelings for her, then why did he announce their engagement at her birthday party in front of everyone? And secondly, what kind of idiot would insist that she sleep with the guy she's been in love with before she gets married to him? Um. No. No man in his right mind would go there.

SPOILER
  -- And for the love of all good Romance novels, Why do I need the brother's point of view??  Ok, there's this HUGE deal made about why Luke won't get married. His issues with his possible disease, blah blah - and the assumptions that Sabrina jumps to being shared with ALL of Luke's friends. Then us, the reader getting to see each and every one of those folks's own eagle eyed view of their reactions.

Really?  The book could have been happily shorter with just the normal he/she pov swap between the two main characters. I don't care how fleshed out the author wants the side characters to be. This was soooooo frustrating for me. I eventually just started skipping those chapters, because I do not want nor need to know how every single person in the story feels.  Honestly, in order for me to want to follow up and read the other characters' stories, Let them be in the story enough for me to care, but with enough unknown for me to be curious about what happens to them. At this point, no way do I want to follow up and read about them, since I'm convinced Ben is plain stupid, so the other side-kicks must be, too.

2nd issue: first chapter - no, first paragraph - had way too many names and characters in it for me to keep people straight. Maybe that's not an issue for other readers, but I shouldn't have to read and re-read and re-read again to figure out just who is who and which character I'm supposed to be caring for.

3rd issue, and, well, this is a typical issue in romance novels, so I shouldn't be surprised, but Sabrina is a NURSE. And she's been up front and blunt with Luke through most of the story. So why the hell would she, a nurse, FAKE an illness to get Luke to be concerned about her??  Why not just say, ""Ok, I know you'll be upset that I found out, but I found out. Let's discuss it."" And at that point, he can either refuse to talk about it, as is his way, or he can do the manly manly thing that we all love so much, and break down and discuss it.

The games just make me nuts. Oooh, let's get engages to make Luke admit he loves you. That didn't work, so let's force you on him as his nurse. Oh, it worked! Yay! But he doesn't want to get married. Ok, let's fake an illness. Maybe that will work.

Yeah. That's just an awesome way to start a real relationship with someone you love. Um, Newsflash, that's not love. That's just being desperate for the guy you want to mirror back your wants. I'm halfway through the book writing this review because at this point I'm ready to just skip to the end because I know I'm guaranteed the happy ending.

The happy ending that really shouldn't be a happy ending at all, because Sabrina's pretty much based the foundation of their being together on games and lies.

*sigh* this makes me sad, because I really love, love, love the best friends to lovers stories.

So, Please, Ms. Kellogg: Don't give up writing. You have talent, absolutely.  I request that you edit out the extemporaneous viewpoints. Use the power of the awesome chemistry that you convey so well to make your characters do more than play juvenile games with each other. I don't mean to be rude about that, but that's how it felt while reading.","Great Chemistry, Some Issues",3,8/8/2016
2580,1,A2DK1O0CDLENN6,B00GT84JJU,"This has got to be one of the strangest romances I have read. And I did struggle all the way through it. The only thing I can figure is I didn't fully read the synopsis, and thought I was getting an erotic menage story. I KNOW I didn't read the reviews, or I wouldn't have downloaded. See other reviews and the synopsis for the story line, but let me just say that the medical aspects of the story were just too clinical. We get that she's a peds nurse and is educated, but spouting off medical info and jargon about a disease that seems to take over the whole story is too much. Along with other medical  issues that crop up, I felt like I was reading anecdotes from JAMA. Each character makes their life changing decisions rather quickly. And a ton of characters... I needed a score card; I couldn't keep up!

Having grown up in a small town in Montana I was looking forward to all the nuances of this story. Yet that was what made the story the most unbelievable. The unrealistic shopping and finding all these women's clothes as well as the supposed level of musical ability by a small town children's choir that would wow a San Diego performing arts professional. Additionally even in Montana you cannot get married without a license. It is the details that make a story believable and other than the snow the other details were just not realistic.
On another note I can gotten this book under Christian fiction. Except for the very occasional swear word (that did fit with the story) it was not Christian fiction. It was a clean read but the lives did not reflect a Christian worldview.

I love that it doesn't take long to become one of their own.  I am not sure most small towns would so quickly embrace a newcomer, but I really want to believe they would.

2588,5,A1CZXR7SMVJ2LQ,B00GU2DJBO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Sara had married her boss and was to leave on a honeymoon taking her now husband, David's yacht. While David was loading the yacht Sara had went on the lounge deck and witnessed something terribly wrong, that caused her to fear her life, and her husband. She quietly had went inside and changed into whatever she could quickly change too, and grabbed a bag with what she could and escaped, taking her husbands car. She was trying to put as much distance between her and what she witnessed as fast as she could. She feared for herself and for her sister's safety. Sara was smart enough to get papers from online, that would allow her to divorce her husband, as they had not consummated their union at anytime, which as she reflected back, thinking that it was him honoring her wish to be married first, but then piecing things together, drew more fear, as to her being used as a front, also making it more dangerous for David to get to her. She had put 2 days between them, but had become ill, as she wasn't prepared for the Montana weather, with her light clothing, and no winter wear.

 Fear pushing her, with sleeping in her car a short will at a time, she became so ill, it was hard to keep going. She knew she needed to stop for something to stop her cough at least, and found herself in Castle Peak as her cough was to pushing her to the point of passing out from the pain and lack of getting a breath. She seen a little store open, stopped in hopes of getting something to help her cough, so she could continue her travels.

Trent, the local law enforcement was making a stop, to get something warm to drink noticed the out of state tags as he was heading inside. Inside he watched Sara's struggling, and had questioned her, while helping her to find what she asked for. Unsettled with her condition, and the bad conditions outside for travel, Trent had decided to check the direction Sara had turned and found her curled up under a light blanket passed out in the drivers seat. Trying to get her attention as he was able to open the unlocked driver's door, he picked her up and moved her to his vehicle and headed back into town, heading to the town Doc.

And the story unfolds, as the doctor see's the bruising while checking her over, gives her some medicine, and Trent taking her to his home, with his Aunt, instead of putting her into custody. As Trent finds out what was pushing Sara to travel without proper clothes for the weather, he touches base with a former Agent he had trained with to have Sara's story checked out. Sara wasn't sure why she trusted Trent, and Trent wasn't sure why he felt so strong to protect Sara, as no other had provoked. The link of Sara's story was connected to a drug ring, and people that had been wanted and watched for sometime.

The story kept me turning the pages, tied up in wanting justice and II connected with Sara's character, needing a tissue many times, feeling her emotion and fear. And Trent, there is a lot to love about his honor and caring, as he helps pull together info to nab the drug ring and unfolding the parts of the story that David had hid and shielded from Sara. Castle Peak is a small town, where folks take care of one another. I loved it, and was happy to read tidbits of the next 2 story's that gave me insight to what happened to some of the other characters....Delightful!!

First of all, this book consistently violates the number one rule for fiction: SHOW, don't TELL.

Second, I learned in the third grade not to skip spaces between paragraphs.

Third, I'm only 27% through the book, and I have already found plenty of grammatical and punctuation errors.

Fourth, you'd think that with access to the internet, the author would have bothered to do even the most basic research. Instead, there's a character saying ""Trust me when I tell you that they don't have mountains and snow in southern California."" Oh, really? I've lived in southern California all my life, four years of which were spent in the San Bernardino mountains, and I shoveled plenty of snow. In fact, I lived just a few miles from a ski resort.

Best bits: Well, there's no premarital sex (or post-marital sex, in Sara's first, brief marriage). And they go to church.

Issues: Apparently Sara is an impulsive, unobservant romantic, who wished to be married by Christmas after watching Hallmark movies.

Trent's not big on dating, but when it comes to Sara, he's super confident, planning to propose before knowing she loves him, and then making all the arrangements for an instant wedding, too. Which might be less ridiculous if they hadn't just met. Almost more typos than not.

2612,3,A3FR8F896KGR6D,B00GV9V87S,"Description: This book is a list of 49 wacky excuses for kids who don't want to clean their rooms. It is a humor book with a cute image for each excuse.

In Short: This book is non-educational and has no lesson or moral. It is just for entertainment purposes. The writing of the book makes it ideal for ages 10+. Some of the words and phrases may be too difficult for younger kids. Each 'excuse' is a silly joke and this book will be well received by children who favor joke-books.

Pros: The art that goes along with each excuse is really cute and funny. Some of the excuses were really creative and silly. A few of my favorite excuses I think make this book worth getting. It's good that the kindle version is free so you can see if your child likes this author's humor.

Cons: Some of the excuses didn't really make that much sense and some weren't all that funny. Even with my childish sense of humor there were no audible laughs while reading unfortunately. I like children's books to have a moral/lesson/happy ending but I felt that instead this one was pushing the boundary between teaching creativity and compulsive lying. Maybe if it was funnier it could get away with it. There were some typos, it could use a little editing.",Cute,2,7/20/2016

So sleeping later into the morning than most, its no wonder she missed her Aunt Pegs frantic phone call. Adams in trouble! Heshes been arrested. Her cousin Adam Muller was found standing over the victim, and despite his diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome and the circumstantial evidence (Blood on his clothes, fingerprints on the murder weapon, and unsolicited outbursts at the sceneIts all my fault, I did a bad thingIm sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry), the district attorney plans to move forward on charges of murder. It looks bad

Along with former public defender BFF Grace and questionable PI Duke Brossard, Jamie sets off uncovering more than a few motives and suspects. Spike, the drummer of a heavy metal band the Screaming Zombies, owns a music shop of the same name and is not short on ego and conflicts. Theres the lawsuit from his former band mates, mean and nasty attitude, former lovers, domestic violence, and money, there's always money. Jamie interrogates many of the suspects leading to more questions than answers, and Skypes Adam's hypnotherapy sessionhe is the key. However, a second body puts the whole investigation off key.

This is truly a delightful series! Jamie is a quirky with low self-esteem issues, but she is a young woman trying to find her wayvery realistic! She loves her family, misses her mom, and discovers she is a lot more capable than she thought. Her gutsy attitude standing up to the State Attorney, Nick Dimitropoulos, hell-bent on railroading Adam is impressive, and the banter with friends and suspects is entertaining. It is a quick read, or listen in my case, but not short on enjoyment.

Narrator Carrie Lee Martz lends a marvelous skill hitting the mark with her dry tone for Jamie, southern drawl for the PI, and a New York twang for Marian. She provides the emotional fear for Aunt Peg and the difficult communication for Adam.

I paid much more for that smaller collection, but never had regrets. In fact, Brown became one of my favorite authors, and I would scan the contents of compilations for his name.

This particular collection is a bargain, especially at this low price. The stories range in size, some a few pages, others longer, but each has the distinctive Brown stamp. He has the ability to write sci-fi and lace it with humor as well as horror, as well as a bit of tongue-in-cheek from time to time. Brown writes in what I refer to as the old style of sci-fi, where the characters are important but what they do within the story itself is the main focus. And Brown excels at telling a great short story and getting his point across.

Let's see if I can remember everything. Jessamine's parents die, everything is left to her uncle.
Jessamine is treated like trash.
Aunt tells her to find a job as governess.
She finds a job with Dallas.
This is where the ridiculous drama starts, so much that I don't even remember each part.
Dallas finds out Jessamine was mistreated.
Falls in love (we missed most of the falling part)
Can't marry her because he has to marry Charlotte.
Finds out his father was blackmailed because sister is illegitimate.
Gets drunk, kisses Jessamine.
Fires Jessamine because he kissed her.
Jessamine's aunt tells the Uncle she'll press charges for the aunt stealing all of the money she sent to Jessamine. He comes back for Jessamine and acts like he knew nothing about what was happening with his witchy wife and daughter.
Dallas says he fired Jessamine so he could court her.
Charlotte and Jess's cousin find out Jessamine is actually the daughter of her aunt, who is a prostitute. The Foster's kick her out.
She goes to live with her mother and the world falls apart for the Fosters.
Dallas still loves her, but now thinks she's his half sister. He approaches Jess's aunt/mother about this. Nope, turns out his sister is legitimate after all as well.
Jess goes to a ball, instead of being cut by Charlotte's friends they are in awe of her.

In a way it is a Cinderella story.  Orphaned girl treated treated terribly and forced to live in the attics (third floor, actually), meets handsome prince (Earl in this case), defeats the wicked stepmother (Aunt and cousin) and lives happily ever after. But it is written in such a charming and witty manner, with twists and turns to keep your interest all the way.  The epilogue was one of the best that I have ever read.  Suzanne Rogers has a new fan!

I do have one question, though.  The cover of the book is beautiful but it caused me to pass this book over several times.  I have a pet peeve for historical heroines wearing prom-type dresses.  I have looked on several websites and cannot find a dress like this one.  Low cut dresses were fashionable for evening but I can't find any that are strapless.  The dress was worn first by the heroine's  mother (1880ish by my estimation) and recreated for her in the early 1900s.  Were there actually strapless dresses at this time?  This inquiring mind wants to know.

2673,5,A2JPS7EMNFKXOV,B00GXBV0MM,"Jessamine's Folly by Suzanne G. Rogers is a very clean but truly entertaining Edwardian period romance. Ms. Rogers gives the reader an interesting glimpse in life in that period as she slowly but steadily weaves a captivating tale of love, loss, betrayal, greed, loyalty, friendship and love. In other words, human nature. Customs may change, but people and their motives don't.

I really like Ms. Rogers' writing and this work does not disappoint. In the face of challenges that would destroy most people, Jessamine keeps moving through twists and turns toward an unknown future with dignity, grace and spunk. Thankfully, she is not a whiner. As with most fiction, I had to suspend some sense of reality, but not too much.

In fact, Lady Midnights entire family is made up of superheroes and they're part of The Mighty Superhero Security Squad (The Squad for short). The Squad is made up of superhero good guys (and girls) whose job it is to protect mankind from evil doers. When The Squad goes bad Lady Midnight finds herself on her own in her quest to save the world.

When I read this books description, I was intrigued. A superhero cozy mystery is certainly unique. And, Chasing Lady Midnight certainly is just that  unique! Its also great fun. What an imagination Ms. Ragsdale must have. Shes created a fascinating world of superheroes, villains, agencies and more.

The book is written from the POV of Hannelore (Lady Midnight). There is definitely some faith-based writing inserted in this book. The author mentions God, Gods will, etc. I was reminded of one of the seven deadly sins when I first read the blurb: A superhero agency that was once good, but now Wealth and prestige seem to have become the main goals of The Squad instead. (Gluttony?) Yet, I would have to say that the book is definitely not preachy. It simply speaks to our current society and human nature in general.

Hannelore is likable, with faults that most readers can relate to. The story is satirical, witty, quirky and entertaining. Its a short book and the authors easy writing style makes it a breezy read.

2686,1,A3RME7ZNP6PYJW,B00H0GED9Q,"This is why I am annoyed:

First, don't put someone of the cover that looks like a 17 year old clean cut boy not finished with puberty then describe Mick in the book as a muscular tattooed twenty something bad boy!

Second, don't put this under romance when there is none! The book was mostly about Quin, her family, Teagan's lawsuits, Colin's artwork and Alissa's pregnancy. Mick was hardly in the whole front half of the book, she spent more time with his brother Colin! Mick came to dinner once at the beginning, they kissed once 2/3 through the book, 3/4 through they try and go on a date that never happens putting both of them in the hospital and then at the very end of the book, they kiss for the second time, have sex, fall in love and move in together. The whole book is over a three week span!

Third, we find out at the very end Mick was dating the deejay for a year the first time he kissed Quin, then he broke up with her. Not surprising since we learn nothing at all about Mick's life except bits and pieces here and there.

Fourth, I am all for strong females but just a smart mouth 24/7 is a lot to handle. I guess Quin in the first book was doable because she was in doses. She has two loving parents, beside having a brother she adores with special needs she has had no trauma. What is the world is all the attitude for?

Fifth, I am annoyed this was nothing like the first book! Teagan and Rebel were great. It was a story about them and how it developed. It moved a little slow but they were together figuring things out, there was chemistry, you got to know them.

Now I am pretty sure the 3rd book about Colin and the pregnant Alissa (we meet in this book) will be more about her pregnancy, the lawsuit that Teagan is involved in and the what happens with Quin's brother and social services. How much of this will even include Colin? All these books are first person from the girls perspective. The author does not do a very good job letting us get to know the men in their life. I found myself skimming a lot trying to get to the point of this book that is Quin and Mick, sadly I never found it.","Disappointed after the first book, so annoyed again!",3,6/17/2016
2687,2,A3H9YS363G2IB4,B00H0I5PZA,"The plot is based on a vague concept that in some alternate universe some super weapon took control of the world and everyone in it.  The people of this world have reverted to a hunter gatherer nation where everyone belongs to a tribe.  There are very few details on this super being leaving the reader very confused.

The main plot of this book deals with the relationship between Arena and Kace.  I really do not like single POV novels.  Fifty percent of the book ends of being way too much long winded inner monologues that drive me crazy.

First of all I should say I could only get through thirty percent of the book before I called it quits.  C.M. Owens is one of my favorite authors but I just couldn't hang in there for this one.  Arena Im sure was meant to portray a strong kickass female heroine, but she really was just judgemental, annoyingly snarky, stupid and immature.  I liked Kace in the beginning, though, even he started not to make too much sense.  One minute hes hot next minute hes cold.  Which really sums their interaction with each other fairly well.  Wishy washy the both of them.  So I will not be either finishing the book or reading further, but for those of you who wish to make the leap, get ready for a slow ride.

Pros:
* Fairly priced (Book one was free, and books 2 and 3 were about $1)
* Badass heroine
* Lots of fast paced action
* Creative concept
* Pretty sexy at times

Cons:
* At times it felt as if there were simply too many characters.  On more than one occasion I had to reference back to see exactly where a certain character was introduced and who they were etc.  This tends to take away from the character depth of some of the main characters.
* As listed above in the pros, I LOVE a strong heroine.  However, at times, she was too over the top.  She was the best at everything and constantly excelled and anything and everything.
* I wasn't a fan of the love triangles and there were a couple of these going on - however, I must say to my safe reader friends out there, once the hero and heroine hook up they are completely loyal and faithful to one another.

Overall, I'm glad I read this trilogy.  It was fast paced and kept me hooked.  I've already downloaded more of this writer's other work to check out.",A creative story concept with a tough heroine and lots of action,4,9/20/2016

""New"" content is typically redundant because there really isn't anything new to add, and then you get people like Joshua Becker who somehow makes a living by writing the same blog post over and over where he yells at you to sell your car or something else that would be extremely bothersome to go without.

Courtney Carver continues to be the standout writer in an internet full of Joshua Beckers.  She shares thoughtful dialogues on the mental and emotional aspects of living without excess, commenting on specific concerns that crop up in day to day life but aren't significant enough to address in the ""getting started"" books.  She does not veer off into extremism like many of her contemporaries.  She gently guides you to consider the effects of your purchases, your time wasting habits, and even the way you eat on your holistic wellbeing.  I think the best audience for this book is minimalists-in-progress who could use a little refresher or some quick inspiration.

I would recommend this for either right- before- bed, or on the beach, a quiet afternoon, etc. There are quite a few dynamic features to the story line. A few twists and tunes, and the characters are pretty well developed. There are a few parts that could be edited slightly better, but I do know most authors on here prefer for their readers to help them out in this aspect.
It was not hard reading by any means, but it was also not an elementary level book. Be prepared for some love scenes. But honestly, sometimes they do add to the storyline, right?
I hope to either purchase more in this series (if there is one) or get the author motivated to write more! Not that this was left with just a cliffhanger or anything, I have just loved how the storyline was developed, and would love to know where this could head into the future. Knowing how the characters have developed, interacted, and have grown leaves me with a lot of hope for more.

The author's use of ""gritty"" words (""Hock up some phlegm"") is an attempt to make the characters more real. He only succeeds at make the story more gross. The gratuitous and generously used swearing is also almost never called for, but used with relish. Jake Walker, the homicide detective who is the main character, is a divorced father of three teen girls, and has an ex-wife with whom he has a love-hate relationship, but mostly hate. He is a workaholic cop, which is mostly what drove his wife away. Interestingly, his kids think he is the one that caused the divorce, since he walked out on the entire family. Actually, the wife was in a long-term affair, and he refused to stay in the same house with a cheating spouse; no second chances allowed. However, he won't tell the kids what really happened, in an attempt to keep things civil.

The story (besides the large amount of information about his personal life) involves a very prolific serial killer that has a penchant for killing the players, coaching staff, and family members of the local college football team. The murderer was quite motivated, since it seemed like there were multiple murders per day for a while.

Other than Jake, the detective, character development is essentially non-existent in this story. His partner, Flo, seems to be little more than a gofer and baby-sitter, the police captain is the curmudgeon with a heart; the press is, of course, always trying to mess up his case (he thinks) by gathering facts, and the football players don't seem to take the whole thing seriously. The story line is quite thin, so the author tries to flesh out the book by including a lot of family interaction between Jake, his kids, and ex-wife. It tends to derail the entire story. At least for me, even the question of who was the killer is answered early on; from then on, it's just a matter of turning pages until you find out you were right.

The book is rampant with grammar, spelling, tense and homonym errors (air<>err), along with quite a few dropped words. Often that is not a big problem for me, but this time it really detracts from the book.

The author also sometimes loses track of names he has used for characters. Near the beginning of the book, there is a scene between Jake Walker (the lead detective) and two of his children, Abby and Sandy. In the middle of that discussion, he mentions Rose saying something, as if that was the name of one of the children. There is no such character in the book at all. At another point, they are discussing a girl named Jasmine, but then later call her Jessica. All these problems really look like sloppy editing or none at all.

The story line tries to use misdirection in an attempt to build tension, but the story content just isn't strong enough to pull it off. Some people may enjoy this book, but I was not one of them. All I can say is - try it for yourself. It is not so long that you will lose a lot of reading time.",The Red Herring Is Too Weak to Even Swim Downstream,5,9/1/2016

2720,4,A1VY2WZOXX2HG4,B00H4YZ21C,"I read the first book in this saga in 2014. I liked it well enough to put the series on my to read list and this week I reread book 1 and read books 2, 3, and 4. While this is definitely teenage romance and angst, it also dystopian and paranormal. I think teen age girls will really like this series.

Overall, Davis has created an interesting world in which talented people having various psychic abilities (morphing, light manipulation, telekinesis, mind manipulation) are separate from the rest of the country. The purpose is to protect them, allow them to use their powers without feeling prejudiced against by normal people, teach them to use their powers - or so we are led to believe. Forced testing of children at age 5 and taking those children who are talented away from their homes is a touch subject that has resulted in 7 states withdrawing and creating their country. Those in the US are raised to believe that the states that revolted hate them and those leaders kill the talented.

Eventually, I got used to the romance and annoying childish behavior by Talia. Eventually, it led to the point that controlling ones power is emotionally challenging and certain adults are prime examples of how power leads to the hunger for more power, politically and internally. Davis created an interesting world and well-defined characters. I appreciated that her character development extended past our protagonists and antagonists to their friends, families, and other minor characters. I liked what most would describe as paranormal abilities but which aside from morphing are what science fiction used to refer to as ESP.

The books raised questions of personal liberty exchanged for government protection; truth, reality, facts, and history being manipulated by the winner or those in control; prejudice; fear; what lengths we may go to for survival; science and research and possible perversion in its pursuit; friendship and betrayal. You don't have to spend your time analyzing it but those themes are there in the story of Talia seeking her future, growing up, falling in love, and pursuing revenge for her parents' murders.

Overall, the first 4 books average to a 4 star rating. For me, they just didn't reach that 5 star level of being extraordinary and interesting enough that I am likely to reread them, but they are definitely above average, with the first book being the one that I liked the least. The author or publisher really should re-edit the books as there are some punctuation and missing or wrong word problems - enough of them that I was annoyed by it in the last book.",I liked it well enough to put the series on my ...,3,10/8/2016

Great new series by a outstanding new author!
I was given this book for a honest review.",Perfect title for a dark well written story!,3,5/27/2016
2722,5,A20MWYFCWJPN33,B00H5J94N8,"First, thanks to the author for giving me a free copy in exchange for an honest review.

Ariela Solsol was raised by an immigrant, single mother in New York. As a young, spiritually inquisitive teenager, God gave her a vision that forever changed her life. In Arielas vision, her spirit ascended into the heavens where the Lord showed her many divine truths, not just for her but to be shared. Divine Truths Revealed is the fruit of that vision.

In many ways, this book reads like an Old Testament prophetic vision. Ariela experiences a new aspect of her heavenly vision (which includes symbols and at times is hard to describe), interprets it, and then exhorts her readers. These visions show many wonderful biblical truths such as: the mystery of the Trinity, the necessity of the gospel, the importance of Scripture and prayer, the reality of spiritual warfare, Gods plan for Israel and Gentiles, and Gods love for the church and mankind. There are some interpretations of her visions, and thus Scripture, that not everybody would accept, but in general, the doctrine was sound. In fact, I was very edified by the readingit helped me focus on heavenly realities instead of earthly ones (cf. Col 3:1-2).

Here are a few of the wonderful visions and truths that stood out: In one of them, Ariela saw a heavenly garden full of children playing. The children were always in the presence of Jesus, and she discerned that this was where aborted and miscarried babies went. In fact, she saw her own miscarried children (even before experiencing miscarriages). This is what she shared about this vision:

This part of my experience, I believe, has a message for women who have aborted or miscarried babies. Society and the culture they live in told them they were aborting a blob or a fetus. Society neglected to inform them that they were indeed murdering their own child! Now, after many years, perhaps, they find themselves laden with tremendous guilt, and hopelessness in their souls. The guilt may come many years later when they finally realize the sad truth and consequence of their actions. Sooner or later they must come face to face with the honest realization that they did not allow their child to be given life.

In addition, she speaks about how there will be a great reversal in heaven: What matters on earth matters very little heaven and vice versa. In fact, many will go to heaven with nothing attributed to their account because they lived earthly lives (cf. 1 Cor 3:15):

Wealth, positions of honor, countless academic degrees, or material possessions will mean nothing, to us when we find ourselves in the infinite realm. They will be of absolutely 'no' help whatsoever! I cannot stress this enough because I, myself, found this detail of the difference between the finite, and infinite realms of existence, so difficult to believe. I was experiencing it, yet it was a fact that amazed me, and still does to this day. Only after a soul experiences this reverse reality on their own, will they be able to understand this mystery.

Also, from her vision, she shares how important prayer is and how angels bring our requests before God (cf. Rev 8:1-5).

While in the spirit, I was shown the awesome, consequence of fervent prayer. The sacredness of the scene is very difficult to describe and was almost heartbreaking in its utter beauty and holiness. My spiritual eyes observed as the Hosts of heaven gently carried the precious pearls of our prayers in their arms, and placed them at the foot of the throne of God.

These enormous, angelic beings full of grace and beauty, continuously gather our fervent prayers, and lovingly place them at the foot of the throne, as if they were priceless gems. A powerful prayer can be very short such as the prayer of the repentant publican: ""God, be merciful to me, a sinner!"" Or it can also be simple as the prayer of the blind man: ""Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me!"" The prayer of the thief crucified next to the Lord, was a very simple, and short prayer..."" Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."" Yet, this prayer was answered, by the Lord, Himself, that very night! The effectual prayer of a righteous man availeth much. (James 5: 16)

I wish the book shared a little more about Ariela (i.e. how the vision affected her, some excerpts about her future story, what her current ministry is, etc.). It is always nice to get to know the author, especially in a testimonial-style book like this. And, the book does end a little abruptly. It doesnt have a concluding chapter to summarize and give the final exhortation or any post-matter. But overall, I was pleasantly surprised and encouraged by this book! I commend the author for boldly exalting Christ and his Word, exhorting Christians (including myself) to live in view of our heavenly future, and calling unbelievers to respond to the gospel!

This book is by far much more than I expected (that's not saying I wasn't expecting it to be good or anything). From the beginning, I couldn't feel anything but the raw emotions Sophie was feeling. Sophie is such an inspiring character with how she speaks her mind, loves with all she has, and drives that truck like the badass she is! Ana is the best friend everyone wants in their lives, with how blunt and honest she is with everyone. Then, there's Chase and Drake... where do I even begin! They are the image of perfect by far, with how blunt they are with the girls, Chase with how sweet he is, Drake with from the first moment you meet him at the gas station, you just know the perfection about to come from it. Then, there's Lauren... oh Lauren. You didn't stand a chance. In the bar scene, I knew what was coming and couldn't help but cheer for Sophie! Is that horrible of me? Haha. This book kept it's grip on me, the whole way through and I never wanted to put it down, which is saying a lot because the last few books I've started reading I couldn't get very far. These characters have a strong hold on my heart and I can't wait to read more. If you get the chance to read this series, DO IT!

2725,5,A2L38HNRNP4AIC,B00H62TMJA,"Ana and Sophie have reached the decision to leave their hometown and Ana's childhood home.  This is an attempt at moving on after Ana's brother and Sophie's fianc Jack died in Afghanistan.  That doesn't mean that saying goodbye is going to be easy. I started sniffling as Sophie visits all the special spots she and Jack had around town and downright sobbed when she reached the cemetery.  When she screams in her sleep, I continued to sob even as I read Ana waking her up.

We learn a lot about Jack through memory & dream sequences from Sophie, throughout the book.

Ana meets Drake Mitchell by bumping into him literally (not with her car) at a gas station, and Chase Mitchell (his cousin) sees the woman of his dreams singing in a pickup truck shortly after this encounter.

When Chase and Drake get off work they head to their favorite bar for a couple of beers before heading home.  Imagine Chase's surprise when he gets to save the ""woman of his dreams"" (Sophie)from being hit on by a nasty drunk and Drake's surprise to find that Ana is the new bartender.

Getting to know Sophie isn't an easy thing to do. The walls she has erected are hard to penetrate but Chase is determined.  Drake and Ana have hit it off well and since Sophie is Ana's roommate the possibility of meeting up frequently is definitely in the cards.

Ana and Drake get off to a very steamy start, with panty melting scenes almost from the start.  Chase on the other hand has to go slow with Sophie.

One of my favorite scenes is the morning after Chase and Sophie's first date which ended with just a kiss.  Drake has spent the night with Ana and the three of them are in the kitchen. Ana and Sophie in robes and Drake in just a towel.

Sophie's POV

""Knock, knock!""  I hear Chase's booming voice traveling through the apartment.  ""Sorry, the door was open so I just let ,,,"" He stops dead in his racks when he sees the three of us in the kitchen, all of us silent and gripping our coffee mugs.  I turn to see his eyes on Drake's towel.  ""Why is everyone naked in your kitchen, Sophie?""

Chase and Sophie have a rough time of becoming a couple, first by her not being open about Jack and then with Lauren ( Chase's ex )doing as much as she can to break them up.

I laughed a lot and cried a lot. Wanted to smack all the characters at least once during this read. Although it is a cliff-hanger I don't mind so much since I already have the next three books.

Although I picked up this book some time ago, I hadn't had a chance to read it until recently. I'm sorry I delayed doing so! The characters in this book were extremely well developed, and the plot twists were like nothing I expected. The opening scene with the haunted house? I never saw it coming- I thought it was a dream sequence, or perhaps a really amazingly unique haunted house experience that would turn out to be smoke and mirrors. I never saw it coming, and it was all twists and turns and surprises around every corner from then on.

I loved the Super Market, and cannot wait to learn more from future installments. Special blood wines, spa treatments, all forms of mythological creatures around every bend. It was a pleasure to read, and I reread several passages just to soak it all in thoroughly and picture it in my mind.

The only criticisms I have aren't even actual criticisms, but personal preference. I like that there are clickable links to learn more throughout the story, but my personal preference would be to have them indexed at the end of the story instead of in the middle of the chapters, as it pulled me out of the story as I was reading. And I found the endearments a bit... off-putting, I guess you could say. Definitely not words that would ever come out of my husband's mouth!

This is that book for me.  I picked up a set of books written by several up and coming sci fi/fantasy writers.  I had never heard of The Tome of Bill (I know..I live in the dark ages!)  but delved into it thinking after a few pages that it would be a really funny spoof.  Boy...I got that and more!

This is the first time (other than my images of the old Nosferatu movie) that I have heard of a vampire in less than a 10 out of 10 in looks.  And I am soo cool with that!

Aghast at the unexpected twist in her fate, Aniri accepts, but never intends to follow through.

Aniri is awesome: strong female character, daring climber, amateur spy. I found her a delight to read. She follows her heart, but tries to do the right thing.

This is a short, romantic novel, set in some imaginative place reminding one of India, where it is warm, and also the high Tibetan lands where it is so cold.  Anini is the third daughter of the Queen of Daria and just eighteen years old.  Her two sisters are married, although one is already a widow.  Anini is in love with Devesh, a male concubine from another country, but they can never marry, and not even cohabit.  This is her first and only taste of love and passion. Her mother, the queen keeps careful reign of the country, but doesnt seem to care much about Anini.  A prince from an adjacent country comes and makes her an offer of marriage, because he is afraid the two countries will go to war otherwise.  There are rumors that his country has some kind of skywagon, which is huge and made for war.  Anini does not want to marry, but she decides she will accept his offer of marriage and go there for a month before the wedding and spy out his country to see how dangerous the situation is.

The story sort of breaks down when Anini carries a sword and can fight with the best of them and then there are pages describing their war equipment and her attempts to get on and off certain war equipment.  It is like a fairy tale and should be read only as entertainment as there are places with all of these uninteresting descriptions, the reader just skims the surface.  I suggest this tale is more for young adults or even teenagers rather than for mature readers.  That is why I can only give it three stars.",A fantasy in the mideast,9,5/14/2017

2754,5,A24RR82KNIG7VZ,B00H8TBQCC,"This book is fabulous.  It's a unique tale about the third daughter of a royal family in an Indian style steampunkish world. As the youngest, she has not the same expectations on her as her sisters, and so tends to be somewhat wild and unthinking. During the course of the story, however, she grows up. It's a wonderful coming of age story, and I loved watching her mature throughout the series. She learns that when forced to, she has a strength and intelligence that she never thought she has. Perhaps it's the same for most of us in that we don't know our limits until we are tested, and this is why such stories are so satisfying.

The author has a rare skill; she writes books so well that you can't really find fault with them, unless you're a real idiot. Clearly some are. I don't usually rant in public, but I make an exception this time, because I'm appalled that some people can give a 1 or 2 star rating to a book that is clearly so well crafted that Ms Quinn's abilities as an author cannot be questioned. It seems that they are either bullies or simply more interested in themselves than in a good book. They certainly don't care about whether sharing that a book that was 'not for me' is helpful to others or not, because it isn't. If the beginning wasn't to your liking, why lower the star rating of a book because you didn't read the description and the sample before you bought it, and then you thought to tell the world about it. I want to read reviews from people who chose their books intelligently, and then read it.

One's perceptions are so coloured by our preconceptions, that unless I know a little about what framework a reviewer is viewing the book through, their opinion is not trustworthy. But let me get back to the review of the book. I have been guilty of reviewing the reviewers. I suggest ethics and consideration of others are worthy aims in reviewing - as in life.

Anyway, back to the book. It excels in all areas and has all the elements needed for a riveting book as well as a great depth of characterisatoion, and all why being completly fresh in her handling of the subject matter.

So the pros were that this was a fun paced action packed book, that had great descriptions and a good feel. The steampunk world was new for me and fun to read about. This was all from one persons point of view and was done well. It was a good length. The cons; This biggest problem with this book was that there was no connection with the characters for me. The main character I didn't like throughout much of the book, by the end she learns and grows and changes but it was almost too late. The love story was such a mess and not well done and I just didn't care. That is why I gave it 3 stars and why I won't be reading the 2nd.

Could not resist a series labeled ""East Indian Steampunk."" And yes, despite the beginning where the only thing that can qualify as steampunk is a fencing automaton, there are steampunkery elements here including an airship and aetherorceivers, and yes there's a spunky princess and a romance, a bit of political intrigue, etc, but it didn't hook me enough to want to read the rest of the series.

I guess I've gotten a bit choosy with my steampunk. Flashy gadgets thrown in for the sake of ""ooh that's cool"" no longer keep me interested-- i need serious political or societal ramifications for my steampunkery.

I also am not invested in spunky princesses who, despite being given irrevocable proof that a loved one has betrayed them and doesn't have their best interests in mind, then goes to the loved one expecting comfort and understanding.  There's also some handy engineers who help out the spunky princess when she's in enemy territory for no apparent reason whatsoever, so that was a bit frustrating.

On the other hand, refreshing to have a bit of matriarchal Asia in my pseudo-fantasy world.

Really, it's the epilogue of When It Rains expanded in detail and more. Personally, I enjoyed it because I needed more of this and there wasn't much of it in the previous book. As for my one particular hang up with When It Rains, regarding Kate's ultimate choice, I think she addresses this sufficiently in After the Rain to where I'm content with the overall story and ending, because it's the ending that was meant to be, but took a detour to get there. Also, I had wondered if her past tragedy would ever be confronted again because I felt that she needed some form of justice or affirmation on her behalf and yes, there is a little something regarding that in this book, thankfully. Aside from the first hand glimpse of romantic relationship between Kate and her man, this also sets up the stage for introducing the other characters in this series.

2763,3,AG4UXEXPJYRU0,B00H9K4NTI,"This novella is a prequel to Junkyard Druid. It is a stand alone story; no cliffhanger. Junkyard Druid is available. There is no swearing or sexual situations. It is suggested for middle teens and older.

Colin McCool is confused. After nearly running over a leprechaun with his motorcycle he can suddenly see the horrible shape his town and friends are in. For the last couple of weeks the entire town and everyone living in it have been living under a spell. The spell has convinced everyone they are living their dreams--the perfect job, the tastiest food, the loveliest home, etc.

With his best friend Jessie, (female), he finds out his job is to deal with the supernatural creatures in his area, after training with a druid who has watched over the males of the McCools for almost 2000 years; the first thing they have to do is get rid of the creature pretending to be mayor.

As the author states, this story, the original first in a planned series, differs in many places from Junkyard Druid. For one thing, this story was written for young adults, although appropriate for younger readers, and Junkyard Druid  is aimed more at young adults and adults. The author admits to inconsistencies with the characters, and the occasional plot hole, but humorously states he kind of likes the story in it's imperfect state and chooses not to fix the mistakes because of sentimentality

This showcases Colin's first introduction to the supernatural, how Jessie winds up as part of his team, and introduces the druid who will be his trainer and mentor for years to come. Colin is quite a bit younger; just beginning to leave childhood and age into a young teenager. He's trying to stop sucking his thumb, which the other kids tease him about, and misses his father, who died in a war only a few years ago, terribly.

2768,4,ASQW8Y9DY6LM6,B00HAT57HK,"Robert van Gulik (1910-1967) was a Dutch diplomat who specialized in Asian languages and cultures. He was stationed in Japan when that country declared war on the Netherlands in 1941, but was evacuated with other allied diplomats the next year. For the rest of the war he was in China, continuing as a Dutch diplomatic representative. And it was there that he married a Chinese woman.

It was also in China that he happened upon an 18th century Chinese detective novel, supposedly based on the criminal cases conducted by a judge in the Tang dynasty (600-900 A.D.) The judge lived 630-700 A.D. During World War II, Van Gulik translated the 18th century version of the 7th century stories and titled it Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee. A few years later, he began to create his own Judge Dee mysteries, published from the early 1950s to the late-1960s.

Van Gulik published the mysteries essentially as collections of short stories. Judge Dee, the magistrate who is moved around the empire every three to four years, is the lead character and lead detective. He has two faithful assistants  Sergeant Hoong, a police officer, and Ma Joong, who can only be described as a former robber who has gone straight but retains enough of his contacts and understanding of the criminal mind and activities that he proves his value to the Judge over and over again.

Judge Dee also has three wives (usually known as First Wife, Second Wife, and Third Wife) and children. And each story has a flock of characters  tradesmen, shopkeepers, poets, courtesans, nobles and other well-to-do people, beggars, soldiers, and, of course, professional criminals.

The University of Chicago Press has recently published Murder in Ancient China: Two Judge Dee Mysteries, part of the publishers Chicago Shorts series.

The first story is Murder on the Lotus Pond, and Judge Dee is called to investigate the murder of a retired poet while at the same time investigating the theft of imperial gold bars from a courier. We expect that the two crimes will somehow be connected, and they are. The key to the solution comes from the croaking frogs in the pond next to where the victims body is found.

The second story is Murder on New Years Eve, and Judge Dee is by himself, his family (all three wives) having traveled to visit the family of First Wife. A young boy arrives, frantically seeking the judges help in finding his mother and father. The only clue in the humble abode is a pool of blood.

The stories ring with authenticity. Van Gulik knew enough Chinese language, culture and history to make the stories seem real and true. Chinese justice in the Tang dynasty was not unlike medieval justice in Europe  torture was often used to interrogate witnesses. Although in Judge Dees case, fear of the judge was often sufficient to elicit a confession.

She has few friends - Trixie and Bill -  and is struggling to make ends meet. Her past is mysterious though parts are hinted at. When a mysterious ailment seems to threaten her future as a performer, she heads to the clinic.

Ms Strife certainly starts off this series with a bang, giving the reader insight into future events. She then backs up the story to provide background on our main character. This is a serial so the reader is still left with many questions at the end and it certainly ends on a cliff hanger. However, as an introduction to Ms. Strife's writing, this certainly will leave you knowing whether you wish to continue with the series or move on. It looks like there will be a significant amount of build up, given the pace of this part.

Two warnings for those deciding whether to give this a try: (1) if infidelity is something you have a problem with, this will not be a serial for you. (2) it is written from the first person, which can be a deal breaker for some. I'm certainly not a fan of it, though that didn't affect my review.

2783,5,AQ61HEJLXGXAW,B00HBJ693U,"A Review of Doctor-Patient Confidentiality by Eme Strife

Left wanting MORE - 4.5 stars

When I first saw the blurb for this book, I thought it was interesting enough to purchase it (especially since it was free). As this is the first time I've heard of Ms. Strife, I was curious to see what type of writer she was - if she fleshes out her characters or not. I have to say she did a pretty good job of fleshing out Roni, though there are a lot of things we don't know at this point. When we first meet Roni (Ramona) Gallo, she is on her way to the college for her morning vocal rehearsal. We learn that she is pulling a double major and is the lead vocalist, as well as the lead pianist for the Music Department.

I know this is a serial, with multiple parts, but I was slightly aggravated that the Prologue at the beginning of this book never showed up in this book. I really want to read the next book to see if that part comes up there. I'm anxious to learn what the proposition is that was mentioned in the blurb. ""Never in my life would I have thought that in the events that followed the beginning of a regular school week, a random checkup would end up spawning a highly angst-filled, incredibly confusing, and quickly-unfolding mess."" Excitedly looking forward to the next book in the series.

2785,1,A23V31AXVPHVJV,B00HBJ693U,"I have to admit, the story pretty much lost me the moment I found out the doctor was married. That kind of thing immediately turns me off, and had it been mentioned in the blurb, I probably wouldn't have been too keen on reading it. Just my personal preference.  As for the story itself, the first chapter is all hot and heavy. It was a teaser scene to something that must happen later, however it never happens later in this volume. Then we're brought right to the present, and the story drags quite a bit with Ramona's day to day life. I know this is a serial type novel, and that's all the more reason you want something to grab you, you know? I needed that something to make me want to pick up the next book, and it just wasn't there. For such a short volume, you can't really afford to make it drag. Other reviewers have liked it though, so don't let me change your mind. This one just wan't for me.

Doctor-Patient Confidentiality: Volume One by Eme Strife was kindly provided to me by the author for review. The opinions are my own.",Not for me,7,2/20/2016
2786,2,A2QU05H6Y0DPNC,B00HBSNH6S,"This was one of the darker novels I've read in a while and, for that, I really enjoyed it. Tess, Cam and Adonis present a fairly intense love triangle. Tess has loved Cam for years but he sees her as his best friend. Adonis, Cam's friend, and Tess hate each other. By the time Cam sees Tess as more than a friend, Adonis and Tess start to build some chemistry. I loved the dynamic and concept. The intensity between Adonis and Tess is WHOA hot.

This is a two star story mostly because of the extremely amateur style in the sense that there are a ton of typos and grammatical errors that really detract from the story (""a chance steal a hickey"" was one of my favorites.) There are plenty of instances of completely missing words, like that example I just listed. Grammar issues, punctuations issues, etc. I just can't stand paying for a book and it has typos. I don't  understand how a book can be published without it being edited first.

There are issues with continuity and the lapse of time in the novel. Minor spoiler: Like it's clear that Tess, the heroine, has NOT slept with Cam because she says and thinks as much and obstacles prevent their intimacy. However, time passes without these obstacles and it's just dropped. So did they or didn't they? That's why it's not clear if there is cheating in this novel. It's implied that they did not sleep together, but what the heck prevented them from doing so? There is a part in which Tess clearly is attracted to Cam and is ready to go to bed with him. So what happened?

There are plot holes left and right, or just half finished or unfinished concepts. Like Tess and her money struggles.. or her issues with her family... her jobs? There are hanging plot lines - like the college background itself that doesn't seem like an actual part of the character's lives except as a basic setting and a pop into class once or twice. There are one dimensions to characters that aren't forgivable... one moment a character is loving and kind, then next they are sinister. Characters change their mind about a person or situation without explanation.

A big plot hole that bothers me is that Adonis really, really hates Tess. I was expecting a moment when he may have noticed her as something more. His internal dialogue when it comes to her is extremely hateful. He considers her a cobra, a money grabber, a weed, a man tricker, a blood-sucking parasite, a peacock with a stick wedged up her ***, she's repellant, etc. I guess their chemistry overrode all of that? Why does he never think back to that? For such EXTREME hate, he switches to lust/love really quick without a second's hesitation.

Despite all of those issues - this is a page turning, weird, dark book. If I were reading it for free on Reddit, for example, I might forgive all of the above because it's actually an addicting read with plenty of content, friendships, substance... It's like a story in raw draft form. But being sold on Amazon as a novel? Meh. Get this book edited and flushed out! It's really something special.

Rae's story can be read without any of the others, but you will want to read EVERYTHING by the time you are finished!  I'm addicted!
Rae is from a dirt poor farm in a really regressive religious area near the Mexican border.  She got a scholarship to college, and still had a difficult time persuading her family to let her go, which she only managed by agreeing to room with her extremely repressive cousin, Hester.  The two of them had two more roommates, Georgie and Lizzy, who provided her some relief with a more realistic viewpoint on life.
Rae had a cousin with severe disability problems.  She wanted to get a degree in psychology and open a clinic she planned to call A Ray of Light, to provide all the services that children like her cousin would need in one place.  She was loosing her scholarship in her sophomore year because she couldn't pass her statistics class.  No one in her family could or would help her stay in school.  She would have to go home, marry, get a dead end job, and live the rest of her life like everyone else she knew.  Until then, she planned to party hearty, to the  horror of Hester.  Georgie and Lizzy were putting themselves through school, too, and had lucrative part time jobs.  They decided to share the possibilities with Rae.  As long as it didn't involve drugs and was legal, Rae was willing to listen.  From there, it just gets better and better!  And as an added benefit, the entire Rae series is $0.99!

Sorry, there isn't an American anywhere on the planet who curses by saying ""Bullocks!"" It's just not an American English phrase. Yet the author is heavily invested in applying British English to American characters. It's distracting and entirely unnecessary.

Others have noted the almost near-paucity of female characters, as if the US military was 100% male. And after a rollicking start, the book bogs down with pedantic exposition. Honestly, we don't need to know in excruciating detail the reasons for every small action and reaction among the aliens, the AIs, and the humans. We can figure it out.

2814,2,A1ZGMMP4UJFXO0,B00HGFP8W2,"This book is worth, at most, 1.5 stars, but I enjoyed it somewhat better than that number probably suggests -- mostly because the book came to at the right time, making it resonate with real world implications.

I  loved the STORYi* up until the final two or three chapters. At that point, my investment in Roote's world and the characters populating it stopped being enough to completely offset the poor editing (is it ""Jefferson"" or ""Jeffreys""? whichever it is, ""quiickly"" is not a word), bad punctuation (beyond the comma abuse, mind), word-choice missteps (""identity"" in place of ""entity""?) among other annoyances.

Still, Roote DID create a set of circumstances that made sense in context. That required quite a bit of explanation, and the action took place over a period of five-plus years. Those things, combined with the relatively low page-count, meant that there was a lot more telling than I would usually tolerate. Yet, with Roote's voice, it seemed less unnatural and intrusive than it normally might. (That's a first for me.) I know lots of readers will have issues with it, however.

Only two of the main characters, the main ""good guys"", as it were, worked for me. They were pretty much cardboard cutouts (just like all the others), but I still ended caring about. After all, the fate of the planet was in their hands; their well-being was in humanity's best interests.

I fairly quickly got used to the oddness of supposedly American characters primarily using decidedly non-American English, with a bit of what I like to call ""Cartoon Anerican"" thrown in for good measure. But it proved a distraction until I was able to dismiss it as an idiosyncrasy fundamental to Roote's style. Note, however, that he doesn't get American government and military structures right, either.

There were generalisations about the Chinese and Russian peoples that set my teeth on edge. But as those ideas were ostensibly in the mind of one of the characters, I tried to look past them. It was enough to lose the book half a star, though.

The so called ""Warning"" at the end of the synopsis/description of the book said it contains sensual scenes  of mmf,Yeah well about that,seems some doesn't know the difference between mmf and mfm... Sigh, mmf means the men are together as or as much as they are w/the woman,while a mfm mean woman is at the center of all the sexual and romantic attention,it mean the men never look at each other romantically or sexually...

2825,1,AUF0OPKICU6D4,B00HHCA47I,"OMG, that was just one long series of clich&eacute; tropes, one after another after another. The whole thing is basically the old stand-by 'woman is the mysterious Chosen One, but doesn't know it. She is hunted by the baddy that wants to claim her and rescued by the hero who actually does claim her. In the mean time, she passes out a lot and does stupid things like insist on trying on clothing prior to purchase while being actively hunted, giving the baddies time to find her again. Because obviously a good, sexy fit is more important than anything else, in the moment.'

It starts out with a bad case of the 'for some reasons.' For some reason he wanted to protect her. For some reason he was unaccountably attracted to her. For some reason he trusted her. For some reason he told her things he'd never told anyone else. For some reason he HAD TO HAVE HER. For some reason she felt safe with him. For some reason she was attracted to him, even though they'd just met. For some reason she was wet for him. For some reason she HAD TO HAVE HIM. Just to be clear, from a readers perspective, 'for some reason' is never enough of a motivating factor.

After the 'for some reasons,' we moved on to the fact that the plot basically boils down to who gets to have sex with the girl. Honestly, haven't we moved past heroines being reduced to their sexual availability and heroes being the man who wins the big P in the end?

Then, of course, we had sex by the numbers. 1. kiss. 2. sucking nipples. 3. fingering clit. 4. slip a finger in and be shocked at the wetness. 4. mutterings about being beautiful and 'so tight.' 5. oral sex and instant orgasm number one. 6. PnV penetration, instant orgasm number two. 7. Roaring male climax and instant female orgasm number three. All in about a paragraph, so no room for any emotional build-up or anything and all this after thinking about 'pounding her without foreplay.' (Oh, yeah, so sexy. Argh. No.) Tell me fellow readers, how many times have YOU read this EXACT SAME sex scene? I know I've probably read it a hundred times.

But there are still more clich&eacute; tropes to be had, because we move right into the 'I love him, but I have to give him up' and 'I love her, but I she'll be better off without me.' No one discusses this. No one admits their feelings; all those feelings that developed in about two days out of freakin' no where. There is no chemistry between these two. And of course, we end with her going to him and demanding he accept her. Clich&eacute;! Overused! Horrible!

And all of this is decorated with writing like this: ""Probably from the fact that he could smell her from here, like a summer breeze and candle lit dinners but also of red lace and leather."" Someone want to tell me what that actually smells like and does red lace really smell differently than, say, blue or white? I noticed a distinct lack of commas too.

I mean, I know these kinds of stories keep selling, so they keep getting written and if they're your cup of tea, by all means have at it. But for me, I don't know if I can run in the other direction fast enough. If this hadn't been read as part of a challenge I almost certainly wouldn't have finished it.",nope,3,3/12/2016

2829,3,A2S5EPJ451WL3I,B00HI3MSV6,"The One is a novel that combined a lot of tropes, The plot twists were good, but the characters don't make sense when considered together. When you take it altogether, it averaged out to mediocre.

Magaret lost her mojo as a top surgeon when one of her operations ended up with her patient having lost major brain functions. She ran back home to her grandpa's house, and lived the life of a recluse... without even a phone line. Until one day, a rough cowboy and his son came to visit... the boy has a horse called Storm that is violent. And Margaret has gained a bit of reputation as the Horse Whisperer in the area. Joe Wilde is a widower trying to raise his son, but it's clear his methods are not working, for the kid's alternately defiant and cowed. But Joe and Margaret both came from this small town and she had secretly desired him back in school. But Joe has a girlfriend who seems to only tolerate his son... When his son along with the temperamental horse disappeared into the wild, can the Margaret and Joe unite to save the kid? Can they recognize they are ""the one"" to each other?

For less than 200 pages, there sure are a lot of plot. However, the characters could have been introduced a bit better or a bit earlier, IMHO (like Joe's brother) and some of the motivations are a little vague. There are also some vague plot elements. How did Margaret get to be the local horse whisperer if she left home for medical school and rose to a top surgeon position? How much patience did Joe really have with a horse that wouldn't follow directions? Can't he just buy another one? What's with Joe and his kid? What's the point of keeping the GF that doesn't like his son if the idea is to find him a mother?  Some of these decisions make no sense. Yet some work well.

This cookbook features some delicious recipes (with pictures included) of traditional Israeli/Mediterranean dishes and desserts.

Now what I absolutely loved is that they author included the Western measurements. Take for instance 10g of baking powder. In the US, that would be 1 Tbs. So no searching around on the web to find out what the conversion is!!

I also liked that these meals/desserts are pretty simple. Take the Malabi (a milk pudding). The recipe goes like this:

2 cups of milk or coconut milk

5 Tbsp cornstarch

1/2 Tbsp rose water

1/2 cup cream

1/4 cup sugar

For serving:

Chopped almonds, pistachios and/or strawberry syrup

Put 1/2 cup of milk in a bowl with the cornstarch and rose water and mix until you have a smooth, even mixture
Put the cream, sugar and remaining 1 1/2 cups milk in a pot and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, add cornstarch mixture and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens.
Pour into serving bowls and cool to room temperature. Transfer to the fridge to chill for 4 hours, or overnight.
Drizzle with strawberry syrup and sprinkle with nuts just before serving.
Tip: To make the recipe parve and vegan, replace the milk with coconut milk.

See, even someone who rarely cooks or bakes can make that and not screw it up!!!

One thing I didn't and don't like is how the writer describes the residential facility setting. In my opinion, she makes it sound like Hades on Earth. I am a former counselor, I have my M.Ed in Mental Health. I can tell you, I have worked in residential facilities and even a Master's degree practicum on a psychiatric unit - these settings are nothing like described here. Are they perfect? No. Can they improve? Yes, of course; no one and nothing is perfect.

I truly feel for main character Jacob. He is thirteen and has been in the state's custody for quite some time. Despite his mischievous and defiant behaviors, I think Jacob needs a stable environment where he is cared for, taught well (educationally, morally, and otherwise). As a former counselor, I truly believe he will eventually flourish amongst such positive influences.",A Home & Second Chance for Jacob,2,1/16/2016
2869,4,A2R1M0ZIPGN4TW,B00HM9M5OG,"This story is told from even more points of view until everything coalesces in a reconstituted Neverland. This story is strong in action, intrigue, twists & skirting expectation. There is beautiful writing that creates strong moods & is very self-awaresuch as in the fight scenes when we are warned about what typical villains do before the villains of the scene up the stakes.

What I found a bit lacking was the Wendy/James relationship. They don't actually get that much time together. It's mostly kind of ""soul-matey"" lust-from-a-distance. I guess since this story seemed so focused on Wendy I thought that we'd get to see what drew her in to James -- how he hooked her beyond his blue eyes. Their moments they did have together were great.

With fingers crossed, I bought the rest of the series.....and I'm sure glad I did.  This series is one of those rare finds that you absolutely hate to see end.  All the characters were well developed and had strong, interesting, or diabolical personalities - No wimps for Elizabeth Hunter!

Hunter sets the bar very high for other writers looking to sell a free first novel in a series. If you read this, it pretty much ruins you for the rest.

I could go on and on, but others have, so I won't. Just let me say that it is rare that I pick up a romance novel and think wow, my perception of the world just got a little more broad.

Loved it so much I just finished reading the story a send time about a week after I read it the first time.

She not only follows up on tangible clues, she also has dreams that help guide her investigation. She enjoys it so much that she decides to becoming a private investigator.

Jo Ravens was divorced, packed on a bunch of weight and wanted to do something new with her life. After literally falling on a dead body (again) she decided to become a private investigator. She talked her sister, Pepper, and her friend, Jackie, who is a journalist, into helping her solve the mystery of who killed the woman she found. Since Jo decided this was going to be her new business, she named them Two Sisters and A Journalist.

While this was a cute cozy, Jo irritated me with all the crappy food she ate and sleeping so much. I found the dreams she had featuring the dead woman, confusing to the story so that threw me off, too. It did have a good ending and I was surprised to learn who the murderer was.

A lot of people criticized her eating but I think the author realistically portrayed someone with an eating issue because I have struggled all my life and it's not something you can always just stop.  I've never been able to lose weight, permanently, although I have lost many times.  It's an ongoing struggle for a lot of people and while I don't defend it, I can relate to it.  I should most certainly lose weight and keep it off as I think everyone should if they're overweight and I'm guilty of judging people but I sympathize with them too.  I wasn't crazy about the bathroom stuff but I think it's a funny enjoyable book.  The biggest disappointment for me and it's an issue with practically every mystery you read any more, is when the main character absolutely ignores everything that's patently obvious to the reader and there have been clues galore.

I opened it up to see if I remembered it (I did), but got engrossed in the story again. I enjoyed it just as much the 2nd time around!

Delia, the heroine, is a starving artist who accepts a commission from Jack's, the hero's, mother to paint the ceiling of Jack's office. Jack is from a wealthy well known family, but hasn't yet found anyone with whom he wants to share his life. And then, Delia starts painting the ceiling of his office ...

Jack's teenage sister, Augusta Summer, adds some comic relief to the story, as well as adding an element of teenage angst. She and Delia share an apartment for a while. Other secondary characters, Delia's best friend Justine and her boyfriend Paul, as well as Paul's sister Karen and her husband Steve, add depth and greater understanding to the story.

This is a slow, well developed love story that is a delight to read. You won't find graphic sex scenes and anything more than mild swearing in this book, which is a welcome change of pace compared to so many other love stories in this day and age.

They never pretended to be engaged other than one flippant sentence. I don't recall there being any swearing in here. There was sex but it was VERY tame, like 2 sentences. I think I just didn't feel as connected with this couple as with the first book.

I loved all of the characters, even all of  the seconary ones, both good and bad. The writing was fabulaous, and I loved the way that Ms. Bryce was able to seemlessly weave these characters together to make it into a great read for all.

Delia Woodson is living a free spirited life. She doesn't pray for material things like most women tend to do, she prays that God with provide her ""with enough"". But after sleeping on her friend Justine's couch for a few years, she now wants more. Not a lot, mind you....but enough so she can move out on her own and have her own bedrom with a door. She gets commissioned to paint a ceiling in the office of the CEO of a major company. It's really not her thing, but she needs the money so she'll do what she has to do, whether she likes it or not.

Jack Cabot is pushing 40 and at odds of where he wants his life to go in the future. He's extremely rich, and very handsome businessman. He's spent the last 20 years being the backbone of his socially elite family, having essentially raised his baby sister Augustine/ Gus/ Summer, and has also supported his mother through two extended mourning periods over her last two dead husbands. He could care less if his ceiling gets painted, but if it makes his mother happy, so be it. He's a bit taken back when this woman with wild flaming red hair shows up and announces she's the painter. He's taken with her right away, but she doesn't want anything to do with him, and tells him so right from the start. That is a first for him; he's used to everyone jumping at his feet to do his bidding. Now, this woman just intrigues even more as the days pass. She's made him laugh more in the last week or so since she's been there, than he's laughed his whole life.

These two are totally hysterical together. Throw in the little sister into the mix, and it just gets that much funnier. I loved Justine, but she was a little to whacked out sometimes when it came to Paul. Loved Karen and Sam, too. Diane and Jack's mother, Catherine, sort of turned me off. I have no use for people who think they are so much better than everyone else, just because they have more money.

Lord Drake is so angry at his father for planning out his life, and leaving him no choices.  So he rebels by going off to war, only to return scarred and plagued by horrible nightmares and memories.  Lady Emmaline is a strong and caring young girl, also with her life planned out by her father.  She dreams of true love, but having been robbed of having a season and ignored by her betrothed, she feels that happiness is not for her unless she takes matters into her own hands.

While Emmaline takes a more juvenile puppy love attitude towards it initially, Drake resents his tightly controlled life and joins the military in a time of war. When he returns home his resentment towards the arranged marriage is still present only now it is complicated by flashbacks of the battlefield.  He spends three years ignoring his marital obligations indulging in gaming and whoring.  For those three years Emmaline is caught in a holding pattern waiting for Drake,  she can not be courted by other men and is delegated to wall flower status.

Emmaline tires of her position and decides to force Drake's hand either marry or sever the marriage contract. We watch the two finally get to know one another and Drake slowly realize how badly he has treated Emmaline.  This is a trying story at times.  While Emmaline is quite likeable the same can not be said of Drake.  He comes across as selfish, elitist and at times cruel.  You just can't help but wonder why Emmaline doesn't just cut her loses and find a more worthy man (like Lord Wexham)

2892,3,A2XPGNJ8YUPHM0,B00HMRI5MY,"K.R. Griffiths Wildfire Chronicles is a not-quite-zombie post-apocalyptic horror bio-thriller. It hit pretty much all my buttons there, but unfortunately I didn't find anything terribly new. In general the writing is decent-but-not-amazing, but there are entertaining quotes here and there. There are a few unnecessary internal monologues early on that slow things down to no good effect. Thankfully that gets better over time.

In order for the plot to proceed as desired, one of Johns crew is required to be so stupid that I cannot imagine how anyone would even let him leave the house. He leaves the door to Victors bunker open and then randomly presses a button that turns out to be a really loud siren. Theres gotta be a way to send the group onward that doesnt require so much stupidity.

In 'Psychosis' (book three) Alex is a new character, but hes really here so his evil other personality, Jake, can throw a spanner into the works. For some reason the bad guys know who he is and how to get him, and have decided that unleashing his psychotic self using the infection would be a good thing. (Im starting to see why nothing has gone to plan for the bad guys.)

The story certainly doesnt assume any intelligence on the part of powerful and wealthy people, which makes it hard to understand how they got to the point they're at. Were talking about thousands of people secreted away on nearly twenty bases around the world. That had to take some serious smarts to set up, particularly since with that many people involved it shouldnt have been able to remain a secret before the world went to Hell.

I would have liked more information on how a certain Infected girl is so clear-headed, and particularly why the other Infected are staying away from her. Many of the changing details of how the infection works are inadequately explained or telegraphed.

In a ridiculous example of small world syndrome (which should already be used up by Claire and Michael reconnecting), one of the characters turns out to be Alex/Jakes bio-mom, although that doesnt seem to go much of anywhere.

Note: some of the characters in this series do seriously depraved things to other people. If that isn't something you're up to handling, then move on to another book.

The characters have zero development in their relationship and sadly also zero character development.

I do have to give her some credit since I went on to read the free first three books of the series. Free or not, if she had been a 1 or 2, I wouldn't have continued.

There were (too) many grammatical errors; simple mistakes that the average reader will be able to catch, even if they don't usually have a special interest in those types of things when reading a book. Wrong words were used. Since I just completed the third book - of the actual series - this one is still fresh in my mind as it's one of the last I read. She used ""passed"" instead of ""past"". That may seem to be a simple error - it is - but the books are riddled with such errors.

There were several occasions when she made the mistake of saying, ""Cortland and I"". I'm sure all the examples weren't specific to ""Cortland"",
but I do remember this error being applied to his name multiple times. Example: Do you want to come to the basketball court with Cortland
and I?

I didn't use quotes since I didn't want to look through 3 books to find all the direct quotes. Therefore, a paraphrase is used as an example. This is a simple grammar rule. If you took out the other person and restated the question, how would it sound? 'Do you want to come to the basketball court with I?'  That obviously wouldn't sound right. But, how about - 'Do you want to come to the basketball court with me?'

More accurately, it should be 'Do you want to come to the basketball court with me and Courtland?'  'Do you want to come to the basketball
court with Courtland and me' sounds awkward, although it does follow the ""me"" - ""I"" grammar rule.

The books, including the prequel have these types of errors throughout. Btw, Courland is not a character in the prequel.

So, the characters who are. The two main characters are Sean and Scarlet. It begins with the characters at Harvard during their first year. It's not specifically stated that this is Sean's first year until the end of the book when Sean gives a timeline. We do know it's Scarlet's first day.
Now, when she first gets to Harvard you get the impression that she hasn't met other students. But, then Scarlet thinks about her roommate, whom she seems to already know. It has to be assumed that they had already met prior to her arrival the first day.

She immediately starts the slut shaming of her roommate. While telling us what her roommate looks like, she then lists her own extraordinary attributes. Of course, - Shades of Ana! - she wants to hide her remarkable body as it makes her uncomfortable. No worries, though, as that ends in the series. Then we get 3 books of her telling everyone how hot she is and moans that every person in the world with a penis will, or at least should, hit on her.

Then we meet Sean who immediately sees her and decides she's the most gorgeous, remarkable, exciting woman he will ever meet. By seeing her, I mean he spots her in the dining area of the university. We learn right away that Sean is a ""billionaire"" who's at Harvard to get his degree in business, but more importantly, to sleep with every woman on campus he can get his hands on.

When he finally meets Scarlet, she's a first class witch (you may substitute the first letter of that word anyway you like) to him. Yet, no matter how she talks to him or treats him, she's still remarkable, beautiful and wonderful. Add any other adjectives you wish.

We get a few paragraphs at the end telling us they finish college. There aren't any other college experiences in the book outside that first week.

One thing I did like is that the author does give us the story from both character's pov. I always feel that gives the reader a better insight into who the characters are and how they feel about events.","Disappointed, yet predictable in the ""Get on the Fifty Shades of Grey Bandwagon."" books.

2908,1,ACYAG4UWLQCDW,B00HO1NYDS,"Everyone loves a vampire story but this cliffhanger PORTION of a book wanders all over without any sense of timing, and the characters are boring.  The first part is good up until you have to purchase, then it stagnates, finally giving you a few answers about 3/4 in, then gives you a huge cliffhanger at the end, not concluding anything- relationships, history, purpose, or state of mind.  The main character stays confused through the whole book, never developing.  If she was smart enough to survive the streets at the age of ten she would definitely be smart enough to figure out a lot of things going on around her, including the relationship between Knox & Mace. And she doesn't plan anything, which is very naive and trusting, not at all the way you'd be if you had to fight for survival every day.  That's not how a street kid would be, especially after several years surviving on scraps and being attacked. If she was so beautiful, how did she escape human men taking advantage of her? Did she learn how to handle any kinds of weapons or develop skills of any kind?  Did she team up with someone else? Evidently not,  she was just alone,  confused  & innocent the entire time, until she got married to a very wealthy man.  Huh.  The author also writes about small towns without a clue of how towns and cities run.  Each one has a separate source of water, sometimes power, with large agricultural & ranching knowledge.  They would have greater access to gardens, vegetables, fruit trees and domesticated animals far more than cities would, especially if vampires had no need to bring food to cities.  Her portrayal of small towns is embarrassingly bigoted & ignorant. It would have been different if she explained that this small town was an anomaly, but they're ALL inbred hillbillies, everywhere?  Wow.  At the outbreak of war with vampires people probably would have fled the cities, not towards them, especially since it would be easier to spot a vampire in a small community, and those hunters she mentions have weapons.  Many other writers explore this scenario much better than Ms Fay.  She is smart with business, making money from her writing, but she doesn't have much background knowledge, real experience or skills in research, either in the practice of writing or her subject matter.  She seems as naive as her characters and expects readers to be that way, too. If the writing in the rest of the book was as good as the first section I would give her two or three stars, but it falls flat and stays there, right after you pay for the book.","Just part of a book, and not a very good one",3,5/2/2017

2933,5,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B00HQ9Z8WS,"Although ex-military action heroes are plentiful on Amazon, author D.W. Ulsterman  and his series hero, ex-Navy SEAL Mac Walker, stand out from the crowd. Instead of merely turning his books into treatises on weaponry and high-tech military gadgets, Ulsterman gives readers an exciting, highly personal, and sometimes surprisingly insightful look at the nature of small-scale combat as it exists today. ""Mac Walker's Patriot Threat"" is a collection of three very good to excellent Walker stories.

In the first story, ""Mac Walker's Bullet,"" Walker is in Somalia, and the mission he's successfully completed involved eliminating a rather nasty Somali pirate/gunrunner/all around sleaze. Unfortunately, right after he shot the pirate, Walker himself was shot by one of the warlord's associates, and he now has to make his way several miles, on foot, bleeding and badly wounded, to the border to Ethiopia and safety. To make matters worse, the same guy who shot him comes looking for Walker as well.

Naturally, there's a rather violent confrontation, both with guns and hand-to-hand, when Walker and the man who shot him meet. Ulsterman makes the fight scene (which takes up about one-third of the story) exciting, suspenseful, and surprisingly refreshing simply by having Walker's guns misfire and malfunction. Instead of blasting the bad guy to bits in two seconds, Walker finds himself in a fight for his life, and, due to his weakened physical condition, it's not clear whether he can survive. It's no real spoiler to say Walker does survive (otherwise Ulsterman's series would end with this story), but, thanks to the clever way in which Ulsterman set up the scene, readers are genuinely curious to see how that's going to happen.

""Bullet"" doesn't end when Walker's fight with the Somali soldier does, however. He still has to make his way back to safety, and Ulsterman takes up several more pages describing that in enough detail to make readers cringe. I've never been shot (and I hope never to be shot), but this story does about as good a job as I can recall of describing the feeling in terms with which readers can empathize. Ulsterman also figures out an ingenious way for Walker to take his mind off his pain as much as possible.

""Mac Walker's Hunted"" pits Walker against an even tougher adversary, a rogue grizzly bear that's been threatening Walker and the people with whom he's living in a remote part of Alaska. The bear has already claimed one victim, and, as the resident with the most military training, Walker takes it upon himself to go after the bear.

The bulk of the story revolves around Walker's pursuit of the bear. Ulsterman doesn't get into the finer points of woodsmanship or describe how Walker attempts to track down the bear. Instead, he is interested in the battle itself, and he has taken great care to ensure that the two combatants are relatively evenly matched. Instead of being in full combat gear, Walker has a state-of-the-art hunting rifle, a pistol, and a knife, period (not even night vision goggles). As for the bear, it's got plenty of height, weight, teeth, claw and almost preternatural savvy. Naturally, the two tangle, in a couple of exciting, well-written, close range combat scenes. Although readers can probably guess the outcome, Ulsterman makes it clear that Walker is in actual life threatening danger and his descriptions of the combat are enough to keep readers on edge.

""Hunted"" isn't quite as good as the other two stories in the collection, however, because the author gets into a bit of a discussion of the political reasons behind Walker's coming to live in the Alaskan wilderness. This story is an extension of some other books the author has written about this community, but the political angle is really unnecessary here and slows the story down a bit.

While ""Bullet"" and ""Hunted"" are well-written, but somewhat standard adventure stories, the third story in the collection, ""Mac Walker's Regret"" is on another level entirely. After reading the story, I was given a look at something considerably more profound than what I encountered in the other two stories, namely, a brief demonstration of the horrors of war brought home simply and powerfully.

In ""Regret,"" Walker is in the Sudan, trying to arm and train a group of Christian villagers to defend themselves against the bands of marauding militant thugs who periodically terrorize them. He befriends one local boy named Musa, who calls Walker simply ""America."" One day, a couple of jeeps carrying some of the militants try to attack the village, and only Walker stands in their way.

Ulsterman can describe action scenes well, using short, punchy sentences and paragraphs, and his account of the ensuing firefight is crisp and professional. The shootout is fairly short and, eventually, somewhat suspenseful, but Ulsterman isn't aiming for suspense here. Instead, he concentrates on depicting the bigger picture, the effect the firefight has on the villagers and on Walker, a seemingly hardened combat veteran. The firefight winds up having a profound effect on Walker (the title of this story is no accident), far more of an effect than an enemy bullet would have.

""Regret"" surprised me in a very positive way. I expected a meat-and-potatoes action story and, instead, got something that tugged at the emotions, taking a couple of surprising twists along the way. Instead of a flag-waving gung ho American simply blasting a group of enemy slimeballs to bits, I got a eye opening reminder than war is never as cut and dry as it may seem and that there's far more death and destruction resulting than any actual glory.

Overall, both Bullet and Hunted are exciting, suspenseful, action stories. Regret is one of the best short stories Ive read on Amazon, a thought provoking reflection on the nature of war itself. Overall, this collection definitely merits a five-star rating.",Ulsterman and Walker on Target,4,6/21/2016

2944,3,A3DG2UXH60BDIV,B00HTJJST4,"If you are looking for a hot quick read on a cold winters night you can stop looking.

Cooper and Kayla meet at the airport. She is afraid to fly (has to though) and he has a hero complex. So he tries to make her feel better about flying home. While they are in first class, it comes out that she s also upset cause her family wants her to settle down so she invented a fake boyfriend. It is easier that way- instead of the pity, the looks, the disappointment. Since she is going home for her sisters wedding though she will be asked a bunch of questions about where he is- questions she cant answer since he is not real. Cooper has a few days on his hands so he volunteers to be her fake boyfriend.

Kayla is cute. When she gets nervous she will ramble off strange statistics. I get why she made a fake boyfriend. Her family loves her and means well. Cooper has survival guilt from the war so he is running away- so it is interesting that he runs straight to her. The chemistry between these two is sizzling- although the insta-action is a little too much for me.

To be honest, my favorite part was the fake break-up and the real make-up.  Yeah, I know it makes no sense but if you read the book you would understand.

Temporarily Yours was a fun, hot read that will keep you entertained for a few hours. Nothing really stood out though hence the 3 stars.

This author took what might have been a B grade movie plot and made it into an A grade adventure.  His characters are well rounded and sympathetic, his action is non-stop and well handled, and if you are inclined to think about what some of this fiction may reflect in the real world, there's plenty to think about. I came away with a new respect for soldiers and their discipline and training and an insight into the ""criminal"" as a victim of things beyond his control,  I hope there is more from this author as I will be very happy to read it.",An Original Take,5,7/18/2016

2951,5,A2RTCPQOOWUPNZ,B00HVFAY1M,"Oh my I loved this one! Fun, cute, flirty, swoony and a great shorter chick-lit read! If you haven't read any of Susan Hatler's books I highly recommend that you pick one up. The Better Date than Never collection is a great place to start. They are all stand alone novels so you can pick and choose but the great thing is that all the characters are interconnected in the stories. In fact as I was reading this and all the friends and other ladies in the book kept popping up, I had to go back to the list of books and see which of these ladies gets their own book. I can't wait to read Mel, Kristen and Ginger's books!

Kaitlin is through with the whole dating scene. Done, no more, zip, zilch, nada!!!! No more men...EVER!!!! She's going to enjoy fixing up her new house, the one that the 80's threw up in, and enjoy her life. That is until her two best friends make her a deal, a deal that's too good to pass up. She agrees to go on 5 dates and they will paint the inside of her house-for FREE! See, too good to pass up!

Ok, this is going to be easy. Snag every single man she can find, all the ones that people keep saying they're going to set her up with. One date every night starting on Monday and bam, bam, bam she's done and her friends can spend the weekend painting with her. Win-Win!!!

Oh Kaitlin, Ohhhhhh Kaitlin. Boy oh boy. Girl you need to remember the saying, our best laid plans.... just saying honey!

From date one, there is something out to spoil her plans. Why can't each date just come, not say anything and be done within a few minutes? That would be perfect. I have to say I loved all the different dates and the crazy situations that they sometimes put her in.

But one of the major kinks in her life plan is that bartender. The one who keeps smiling at her, won't leave her alone so she can prep for her first date. Then comes in her friends to watch and make sure she doesn't fake her date. Not only are they causing her more problems but now the bartender has overheard their conversation and knows why she's really there. Throw in more deals from her friends and this simple easy week has just grown more complicated, but hey more free labor always makes life look brighter...right?

Kaitlin is so much fun! I really just loved her character. I loved her relationship with her friends. She's hurting from past relationships and yet she is trying to find peace and joy in her life in a way that she can. But I loved how this book was able to help her heal and find peace from some of those relationships.

Paul, well what can I say about Paul other than the fact that he's something else. Wow! Yeah for those of you who like book boyfriends I can already tell you that you might, nope scratch that, you definitely would find one in him. Ugh, I keep starting to type different moments with Paul from the book but I just can't. I can't! If I tell you then it takes the fun out of the surprises for you. Lots and lots of fabulous surprises await you in this read. Let's just say it again...Paul's GREAT!

Now it is a shorter book and these books always end with a HEA so if you don't like the insta love stories then this may not be the book for you but if I could convince you to take a chance on an insta love book/series it would definitely be this one! Oh yeah!!!!

It's one that I really could go back right now and read again! If I didn't have several other review books piling up and a busy schedule right now then I would so go back and reread it right away. That's how much I loved it! Now you may not have that instant love for it like I did but whether you do or not, I think you'd enjoy it to say the least.

Content: clean. A couple heated kisses but nothing more than a kiss. Susan Hatler's books usually have some swoony kissing in them but are fun clean reads!

They're gonna paint her whole house for free, provided that she'll go on a date with her realtor and four other guys within 5 days. Tempting offer, indeed, especially when she's a little tight on the budget. So for the free labor, she gives them the deal.

Five men for five dates within five days. Not bad, right?

Well, let's see. First date, realtor Chace McDermott arrives late - too late that he sees Kaitlin flirting with the bartender instead.
Second date - with an architect that her mom approves - has Kaitlin hanging up and rappelling down the walls of Goeffries Hotel - again with the bartender instead of the real date. Oh man!

Third date - with someone her co-worker has set up - oh, should I even tell what transpired? Kaitlin thinks of the bartender (who later becomes the receptionist ) all the time while she's on the date. Disaster, again.

What's up with he bartender anyway? You'll be surprised when you finally realize who Paul the bartender slash receptionist is!

I won't tell what happened to other dates that succeeded. But here's what I'm gonna tell you. Licence to Date is a very exciting and funny read, it made me forget about the previously forgettable paranormal book I read a while back.

2953,2,ANSX8LPSIUX2H,B00HVJN63Q,"The theme of each story was interesting, or could have been interesting but they did not work for me.  Maybe audience should be early teen?  The first story had a preschooler who had thought process and vocabulary of a much older child.  Advanced language skills-maybe.  Young adult comments and thought process-no way.  Second story was just as unrealistic, the author tried too hard to inject humor that did not work, and the characters were one dimensional. Oh, and let's not overlook that both H and h lied about their relationship to her family which is a great way to start. The third story was so far out I gave up and stopped reading.  The h gets dumped by her fiance and hooks up with a man who seems to propose to women because he just wants a wife.  Really?-the H is worried about his biological clock?  or he is driven to be married with the house and white picket fence and this is the 21st century?  Then 2 weeks out from the wedding date (when the h has not cancelled venue or catering), has lied to her family and his old school friends and expects the H to propose and just slide into wedding plans made for a different groom.  The invitations for a wedding must have been sent out with the name of the groom blank in order to allow substitution because how tacky could you be?

I read a lot and sometimes you just need to kick back and laugh at the story.  i enjoy the authors sense of humor.  Whether the situations are realistic or not.  In the first story:  A Christmas Catch neither character was looking for romance but they found love in spite of themselves and the miles between them.  Must Have Husband was funny.  Two sisters decide to get away and they go mountain hiking.  Except neither has done anything like this before.  Linda is happily married but Connie has had 3 failed engagements which is unbelieveable for a rich heiress.  But in the woods a man just falls out of a tree and she convinces him to come home with her and pretend to be her fiance.  Lots o funny scenes in this one.  The Sometime Bride is similar in that the engagement is off and she just can't tell her grandmother and her friends.  What are the odds on two brides throwing their engagement rings into the same pool?  About the same as the jilted bride and jilted groom finding love together.  How to Marry a Matador is not as funny as the others but it has hits moments.  A New York exec comes to Spain to close a deal and after a few two many Sangrea, she marries her client.  She's scared and wants to get out of the marriage.  He tried to convince her that he's really in love with her.  She panics and when her best friend shows up...

2)  Must-Have Husband  5+Stars:  This is one of the best stories that I have read in a long time.  Connie and Mac's 'courtship' ranks right up there with a Desi and Lucy episode.  There were times that I laughed so hard that I had tears in my eyes!  Perfect!
3)  The Sometime Bride  4 Stars:  Both the hero and hero have been dumped by their significant others and team up to help each other out by pretending a romantic attachment.  It's been done before, but this time it was done really well.
4)  How to Marry a Matador  2 1/2 Stars:  I couldn't get into this one at all and did a lot of skimming to finish it.  It was unrealistic, more than a little silly, and boring.

2961,5,A39VYGNHLXAVMP,B00HVQIHFG,"I read these books, one right after another, tearing through them in all my spare time, What I thought was a typical dystopian Hunger Games/Running Man trope turned out to be so much more. Don't get me wrong--I love the whole panem et circenses theme--but I wasn't expecting this. First of all, there is a huge cast of characters of about thirty main characters, some of them more important than others. The author does a pretty good job of differentiating them, but he gave most of the men a defining characteristic, while the women were mostly pretty and petite. They were also kick@ss, so I'm okay with that, but it took me until the second book to get them all straight. I was still able to keep up on the story, though, so it wasn't a huge deal.

Unfortunately, I cannot reveal much of the plot, without spoilers, because so much of it is revealed slowly throughout the books. What I can say, is that there are some twists and turns, which really ramp up the suspense and tension. I felt that one of the plot twists stretched a killer's motivation somewhat, but, at least it wasn't one of those books, where the author withholds vital information, so the reader never could have guessed the killer's identity. In retrospect, the signs were there, so, well done B.B. Griffith.

Despite the huge cast, I did come to care about some of the characters deeply, and I was very torn, as I knew, as an American, I was supposed to be rooting for Team Blue, but other teams--Team White (Mexico) and Team Green (Ireland)--had very sympathetic characters. I was dreading the confrontation between my favorite teams, when the story took a very interesting and terrible turn. As I read the third book, I didn't see how the author could possibly wrap it all up in time, but he did and wonderfully, though he made me cry. Damn you, B.B! You know what you did! I can't say more than that, because I don't want to ruin your enjoyment of the story, as it unfolds.

There were a few editorial issues--not enough to pull you completely out of the story--and some words were used in a way I was not familiar with, but I knew what the author was trying to say, so maybe it's a regional/dialect thing....?

Overall, if you're into books like The Hunger Games, Death Race, and Running Man, this is a slightly less-deadly, very interesting take on that theme, and you'll enjoy this series very much.","An enthralling, suspenseful story that keeps you guessing",2,12/10/2017

2964,4,A1JHWKM3FAUWCI,B00HWI04XQ,"Katja is trying to make it as a musician, but is struggling financially, until she meets Micah under unlikely circumstances and they become roommates, then friends, then more.

(Though reviews are inherently subjective, I prefer to provide some organization to my opinions through the use of a personal rubric. The following notes may contain spoilers.)

Plot and Setting: 4.5 -- Plot has many unique elements, no major holes, and a sense of focus. Lots of interesting twists and unexpected events, while maintaining the overall arc of growth for Katja and Micah, together and as individuals. Setting is clear, believable, and consistent. Timeline is a bit hard to follow, as large chunks of time blink by with little notice.

Characters: 4 -- Main characters are relatable, realistic, interesting, and dynamic. Minor characters and villains may be slightly stereotyped or simplified. Definite strong points in the relationships between characters. I enjoyed seeing how Micah and Katja each have strengths and weaknesses, and how they each had moments to help the other and build each other up. One of my favorite things is the way Katja repeatedly notes, with amazement, that Micah is so observant of her that he can seem to read her mind. Katja has good relationships with Regina, Maurice, her mom and sister, and Matthias, too. We get less about Micah and his relationships, and his with his parents felt like it needed a bit more attention.

Mechanics and Writing: 4 -- Scattered typos, punctuation issues, and word errors, including 'new' for 'knew' at one point, and a few awkward bits (such as one time he puts his arm around her waist, and she reaches up to her shoulder to hold his hand--I spent I don't know how long trying to figure out if that could actually work). Intelligent use of 3rd person limited POV--all Katja, which I liked. Skillful writing that adds to the story.

Redeeming Value: 3.5 -- Incidental uplifting themes. Katja learns to value her dreams without ignoring all else, and Micah lets go of the guilt he has held. We get only the briefest mentions of Christian faith, which is disappointing in a book marketed as Christian. Sex, alcohol, violence, etc, are not glorified, but some shaky ground, eg. Katja's brush with prostitution and her occasional bouts of drunkenness. We also hear about Horst's drunken abusiveness, including a near rape, as well as Micah's past as a drug user and alcoholic, and both his and Katja's previous sexual relationships (and Katja is completely willing to have sex with Micah now). Sexual attraction emphasized, and kissing seems to be a large portion of their romance.

Personal Enjoyment: 3 -- I liked it. It was enjoyable and entertaining. I wouldnt mind re-reading it someday, but its not a priority.",3.8 stars: Sun and Moon by Hope Franke,4,6/26/2016

I've always had an interest in this area, having been a freed woman of verbal, psychological and in the end, physical abuse myself. It's been a while since I've read this series, so I can't remember and answer to the reviews complaining about editing issues.  I am a grammar/spelling snob, but those issues didn't stick with me.  The end all of my review is that this series is an important, prime example (even though it is fiction) of the abuse a large part of the unlucky community of women live.  The secrets, the history they've gone through as children and adolescents; it's deplorable and most of the population chooses to turn a blind eye to the many cases.  If you are one of these clueless people who have been heard saying, ""Why don't they just leave?"", then you should read this book.

Overall, I found this book tedious, boring and extremely disappointing as Kurt was one of the Remingtons I was very much looking forward to reading about.

Actually, the last three of books of the Remingtons in this Love In Bloom series has been so incredibly disappointing and frustrating that I will not be wasting any more money continuing this series.

Dragon Ball is one of those universes like Star Wars, or LotR, that I just wanted to ditch my own life for and be a part of growing up. It's just a fun world. There are dinosaurs, but there are also futuristic capsules that pop out full size houses and motor bikes. There are flying clouds (that you may ride as long as you're pure of heart). There are staffs that can grow to a distance equal to the moon at Goku's whim. There are martial artists who can focus their dormant energy into a physical energy blast obliterating mountains. There are alien species that transform into giant monkey-monsters at the sight of a full moon. And that's just the first two volumes!

Mike Montgomery is a graphic designer who comes into the store every morning on his way to work.  Lexi has noticed his interest in Sarah Brooks, a violinist.  However, she just looks on until one day Mike asks if she knows who Sarah is.  Lexi gives him her first name and that she is a violinist.  Lexi suggests she buy Sarah a coffee the next morning.  Mike does, but he does it anonymously.  The two strike up a conversation and a friendship.

2977,4,A2NA95SZ98ZQAT,B00I00O9EU,"I was expecting a bit of difficulty, have such a short book follow six characters. It was surprisingly all woven together quite simply, which made it feel seamless and easily followed.
The characters were all likable, the men all sweet and a little awkward, with the women cast in the more standoffish roles. Though none of the females came across as bitter, just a little wounded. Their backgrounds weren't dug into, though there was mention about Penn, Lexi and Ellen's pasts, so I missed it that there wasn't more about Sarah, Tom or Mike. I would have liked to know just a bit more about them, since the pasts that were brought up played directly into character development and their views on love, and more specifically why they were opposed to it.
I found each story sweet, though there for awhile I was worried Mile was a little creepy. His secret admirer ploys definitely came across with a stalker vibe, and had I been in Sarah's shoes, I would have been scared stiff instead of flattered.
And I would have liked for Tom to be a little more open and forceful if necessary with the blonde bimbo who was always trying to hang on him. But I suppose being who he was, awkward mostly, he wasn't the type of guy to overtly crush anyone, though that did cause him to hurt Lexi's feelings.
And I just found Penn and Ellen completely and totally sweet. No major flaws, just heart-meltingly adorable.

There are quite a few recipes inspired by the Samoas which I love but none quite get it right in my opinion. It's also not all cookies, there are recipes for bark and cupcakes as well which I don't care much for. The title is right- they are copycats recipes but maybe ""inspired by"" would be more accurate. The recipes themselves are clear and easy to follow so I liked that but overall I was disappointed in the end result.

The end of the Civil War; guns booming; men screaming; dying on both sides of the war; and pain in body and soul. Imagine canons blazing and no one could tell whether it is from the north or south but men died. After a huge blast, two men fell together in a ditch, side-by-side and injured; enemies in life, but compadres in death. One man survives his wounds while the other did not. Often it is the guilt of survival that nearly kills those who fight wars. This is the story of the survivor, his brother and their way west to try and lay to rest the darkness of war and find new beginnings. Elizabeth, Libby, and her son, Tad, meet these men and the book carries those lives. I loved every moment of this book.

The modern-day language, come on, it wasn't very modern-day, just enough to make her characters easy to understand. The fact that Jake felt an attraction just 5 months after his fiance was killed? He'd been running and worried, and what, you never heard of love, or attraction, at first sight?
Now, I liked it, the characters were well-written, and believable. But the story had a choppy feel to it, no real flow, hence the three stars.

Syd is the daughter of an Americas Sweetheart actress and Bad Boy modelshe was basically born under the Hollywood lights. This is why she has learned to be wary of everyone because they use you to get what they want. Her famous status has scarred Sydney, traumatizing her from ever getting close to anyone. Her coping method: escape from life and hide from the media.

All in the POV of Sydney, this is the love story of Sydney and Drew. It had a bit of a slow start (in fact, Drew doesnt appear again until like chapter 5 or 6.)

I thought Sydney was being too melodramatic about the media frenzy and people discovering who she is. For godsakes, you cant hide your head in the sand forever. She lets the tabloids dictate her life, which is not good. Also, shes too horny for Drew. All she thinks about is ripping off his clothes the second she sees him.

3023,5,A1GTEFNP9OA0BR,B00I6U2ARW,"This is one of the books I'm always hesitant to pick up because I'm not fond of a protagonist that has lost his/her memories. I did because the plot seemed to be very intriguing. And, now I am so glad I did! The book was well-written, action-filled, and the characters well-defined. Her lack of memory hardly bothered me at all, especially since her personality was defined enough I didn't need any ""background"" information. I liked the setup for more intrigue in the future. Now for a couple things that bothered me. I felt Winter's story was an add-on and rushed at the end. I wish there would have been a whole story just for her and Varian, like it seems the next one is for Madalaina and her potential mate. I wasn't as upset as I could have been because the things left hanging at the end make me excited for another book with Winter and Varian. (Can't say too much because I don't want to give away anything.) And, I was a little, just a teeny, tiny bit, put off by the insta-love. I am more forgiving with shifter stories, but always still find it a little cliche. Although, everything did seem a little bit rushed, it was all still an excellent plot. But, despite my perceived holes in the book, I really recommend it to readers who like urban fantasy. The series has a lot of potential and I can't wait to read the rest!

3024,5,A3CSM5V9Y5O6SY,B00I7BTMJ4,"I listened to the Audible version.

FAIRY, TEXAS was a decent listen. It would be something I think teens as well as parents would enjoy. it was pretty clean with some unexpected twists. The protagonist Laney has to move to a small town in Texas that she's not too fond of but it becomes far more than she expected. She has a strict step father and a bratty stepsister to deal with along with being the new kid in school. But Fairy, Texas is so much more than that in a literal sense.

This was a good listen by author MARGO BOND COLLINS. I think she has a great sense of the genre and I would expect more stories like this from her in the future. A good YA author to watch.

MELISSA MORAN did a fantastic job narrating. She was the perfect voice for Laney. She had a quick pace and kept the story moving. She also had great voice inflections and was a great match for this book.

3028,3,A1JQTU73YS6MT,B00I8OIXGI,Not a true regency era. The main characters are loving. Villains aplenty. Some repetition. It wasn't believable as a historical regency era.,Okay,2,6/28/2017
3029,3,A217BVTGFAZBLT,B00I8OIXGI,"I've started and restarted this review four times so I'm just going to make it easy on myself and be direct in my assessment.

Pros:
1. Semi-unique story line with scarred heroine.
2. Truly despicable villain.
3. Mean girls and snooty society to overcome.
4. Bones for a good story.

Cons:
1. Horrible misuse of titles. The heroine is the daughter of a duke and should be Lady Julia Rosemont or Lady Julia. She is referred to as such occasionally, but also Miss Rosemont and Miss. The hero should be addressed Your Grace, Duke, or Radcliffe. He's unfortunately only addressed as my lord or Lord Radcliffe. Most frustrating of all is that the titles are switched within the same paragraphs on occasion, and several times within the same chapters.
2. Names and their honorifics are constantly jumbled. The two mean girls are sometimes ladies and other times misses. The dukes (both the hero and heroine's brother are such) are always referred to as lords, sometimes with their family name, other times with their title name. The heroine's brother's lost love is called both a Countess and a Miss, despite the fact she's married to a Marquess. Her title name is also switched out for her family name several times. It's a big ol' mess.
3. The hero and heroine carry on in such a way that they would be caught. There's no way, with how they go about themselves, that they would not be noticed. The author says a chaperone is always there, and it's mentioned repeatedly that she is, but there is no evidence of it in her or their behaviors. The brother, who should be his sister's escort, especially given that the reaction to her scarred appearance is making her Season hard on her, is never there, except in late night or breakfast meetings privately with the heroine. He also repeats the same lines every time we see him - are you alright, do you want to leave, I only wanted you to have a good time - and then he vanishes for a chapter or two. It's likely meant to throw the hero and heroine together, but as that is impolite and improper behavior, there's no way any societal good would come from it.
4. Several points of the story are constantly repeated - and that is no exaggeration. In the first three chapters alone, the hero recounts his feelings for the heroine from the day of her fateful accident to the present, in each chapter. She returns the favor. Every time the two mean girls show up in a scene, we are reminded how they want the hero for themselves and why they dislike the heroine, and then they launch into the same taunts and titters. The leads, every time they are separated, recount what went on between them in the previous chapter, despite the fact we just read it.
5. The two male leads are dukes and the heroine is the daughter of a duke, but they behave as if they are on the lower rungs of the social ladder with no social clout. The hero says several times that his rank will protect the heroine, then he doesn't use it. Her brother never uses his rank for social protection either (he rarely attends events or goes straight to the card room; we are told he nurses a broken heart but we never see him long enough to judge for ourselves, and apparently his brokenness is more important than his sister's one-and-only season).

This book was not one I would revisit or recommend to devoted lovers of Regency romance. If you cannot look past misuse of titles and unrealistic historical behavior, this book is not for you. If you must have characters addressed with the same name each time, this book is not for you. If you don't need a summary of what happened in the previous chapter when you move on to the next, this book is not for you. If you aren't bothered by anachronism, mixed-up titles, and repetition of story elements, you will likely enjoy this tale. This novel would benefit greatly from a content editor (to correct the historical inaccuracies) and copy editing (to eliminate the repetition and tighten the syntax and grammar). There is a good story here, but it should be half as long as it is.",Romance - check. History/Regency - not so much.,22,6/1/2017
3030,3,A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,B00I8OIXGI,"To Catch a Duke is a mixed bag.  There are some nice scenes here but also some that just did not fit the period or were a little inconsistent with the characters.

Lady Julia Rosemont suffers from deep scars on her face and torso.  She has had them since she can remember but does not remember how she got them.  She was told it was an animal attack and she has always felt that these scars were a hindrance to her having any kind of successful season.  Julia is the sister of a Duke who insists she have at least one season.

Julia agrees and wants to have a merry time  in Londonas she firmly believes she will never wed and she also is certain she will never return to London.  She is the object of bullying by young debutantes and she hates their words but still soldiers on.  Coming to her rescue is her friend and neighbor Benjamin Sinclair, the Duke of Radcliffe.  Ben has always had a very protective streak for Julia and he makes it his mission to show her a wonderful time in London.  Ben has no real desire to marry and he hates how Julia is treated.

Ben escorts Julia to different London events and there is the assumption that they are courting.  Ben loves Julia but has a secret that he feels will destroy their friendship so he keeps his distance.  Julia loves Ben and wants to engage in an affair so that she has a taste of passion before she heads back to her home in Sussex.

Ben and Julia do not have a strong connection until later in the novel and this is because the two have kept their feelings under wrap for so long that revealing them came a little fast and in a way it was out of character.  I could not imagine a young Regency woman like Julia wanting to engage in an affair with a man who was a neighbor and risking pregnancy.  Also, I could not believe her brother being so accepting of such an arrangement.  Julia is a Dukes sister with a dowry, why would no one be interested in her?  She was not a homely woman. Ben was so intent on keeping his secrets that he was willing to see the woman he loved live a terribly lonely life, ditto for Julias brother.

Additionally, theres a villain in this story who absolutely lacks any subtlety.  The whole backstory with Ben and this villain almost felt like a medieval plot line rather than regency era.

Finally there are some nice scenes when Julia and Ben are truly honest with each other.  These are later in the novel and move the story into a romantic tale with heartfelt dialogue.",Has its ups and downs,3,3/6/2016
3031,5,AWK6TP9DNUKOM,B00I8PMB10,"Such an amazing dystopian tale with vampires that is so different from anything out there. Following a vampire named simply Mira who's a gladiator-like slave in the arena of the city of Iron Gate, she must fight every week or forfeit her life. All she dreams about is escaping, but in the thirty years she's been captive, no vampire ever has.

A brilliant tale of survival, tenacity, and adventure. Mira is fearless and fierce, just the way I love characters. Unwavering in her determination, she even meets someone who might be able to help her. A human named Lucian becomes more than meets the eye and their destinies are forever entwined even though all humans can't be trusted. It's them against the vampires, so how is this going to work?

3032,1,ANTZDY6MNFIHW,B00I9D2SQO,"I managed to finish the book, which normally rates at least two stars. However, this book is so bad that I cannot justify that high of a rating.

1) The whole thing starts because a full-bird Army Colonel is concerned that a Captain is going to take his command. There is a reason rank structure exists, and why some jobs require certain rank. A billet filled by a COL is not going to go to a Captain except on a short-term, emergency basis (ie everyone senior is dead or incapacitated). If that is the case, the COL would have other things to worry about (like being dead), rather than a ""mere"" Captain.
2) Jack and Lori spend more time making goo-goo eyes at each other than practicing medicine.
3) Jack is rather dumb. He knows there is a CID investigation and knows who the investigator is. But rather than tell the investigator what is happening, he and Lori do their own investigations, screw up the official one, and almost get killed.
4) Jumping from Captain to Lt Col in a year is beyond belief.

It started well with the main characters  Major Jack Bass and Major Lori Darden  thrown into a dangerous situation early in the story.  And Jack faces repeated danger throughout the story.

Dasso does a great job narrating action scenes but between them, the story drags.  It seems as if he had a lot of ideas he wanted in the story but couldn't quite mesh into a smooth whole, leaving the story with a disjointed feel.

This download had many execution errors  missing words and the like.  It also had one major continuity error: The main character is addressed as Major Bass long before hes promoted to the rank.  Had this happened once, I would have dismissed it as another execution error, but it happened repeatedly.  People in the military may address an officer by the wrong rank once but they don't make that mistake twice.

Not that this one's terrible - I did finish it. But it fails in the ways most early novels do. There's telling rather than showing a character's feelings, and dialog sometimes good, but too often stilted and repetitive. Worst, a manipulative rather than character-driven plot. Both men fail identically at communicating, not because of who they are, but because it was the only way to make the plot work. Jon never pushes for more, Liam never pushes for more. The bad guys are little more than caricatures. And it's sad because the message is important; domestic abuse happens to men, too, and they get even less support than women do.

Then there was the whole being best man at the ex's wedding - come off it, that's ridiculous. It wasn't even necessary for the plot, which made it even more annoying because it seemed like just a way to add drama and then create a witty title.

Perhaps the most refreshing part of the books was something other than the usual ""tall, blond and blue eyed"" heroine that can fight like a man, etc etc.  Finally got a petite brunette with soft brown eyes!  I always find the need for authors to write heroines who are impossibly progressive for the early history of Scotland to be not only unbelievable but a bit redundant.  The heroines were feisty without having to prove they could out fight every man which was refreshing.  Oh, and the heros were very sexy and appealing.

3043,3,AFZ5N9STEUDU5,B00IAUKWXM,"Entertaining little middle-aged fantasies.  The story craft is competent and the writing is very good.  I didn't care for the format, since none of the stories seemed to be quite book-length, and though some of the mysteries are resolved in each story, another bit of mystery is introduced as each ends to push the reader to continue into the next story.  It had been wise to fold these three into a set, for that reason, since a gimmick like that tends to alienate and seriously irritate many readers unnecessarily.

These stories will appeal the most to older women on their own, and cougar-relics of all stripes, who might greatly appreciate the fantasy aspects of being fawned over and receiving an unusual degree of attention from gorgeous, young gay men, and also being cared for by a hunky young live-in medical professional also.  The various characters tick a lot of Americana boxes being white, black, bi-racial, Native American, wealthy, poor, middle class, and homeless--something here for everyone--and the protagonist has a mysterious and shadowy daughter who flits in and out when not engaged in some manner of dangerous employment and pursuits, also.

Some of the story threads (physical recovery, O'Nan) and the backstory repititions extend to the point of becoming a bit tiresome, but there is enough mystery, history and local color to make these stories an interesting and fun read for many readers.  If you're on the fence about whether to get into this series, I'd have no reservations about suggesting you give this set a try.

3046,1,A3ECFEZZS64Y9J,B00IAZX298,"<strong>Just no...</strong>

There are so many wrong things in this book, I don't even know where to begin. First the characters. We have an immature, selfcententered girl with no self respect and with self destructive tendencies who uses alcohol and sex as a coping mechanism.
Then we have a closed off, jerk who can't have a relationship, because he is emotionally damaged.
So when these two meet is like a ticking time bomb. They start with a ""weekend sex affair"", that develops into a dysfunctional relationship and they use sex as a crutch for their unhealthy behaviors and emotional outbursts.
The plot is not really a plot, is just a series of over the top events that are as dramatic and asinine as you can get. I felt like the author just tried to think of things to add for shock value to manipulate the readers emotions.
Cliched situations and predictable ""coincidences"". They meet and have sex, then discover he's her new boss, then her ex starts working at the same firm too. And of course turns out they even share the same shrink.
The dialogue is juvenile.

Supporting characters: Olive, Pepper, Jordan, and Brayden

Olive, Pepper, and Andi were college roommates. Andi was engaged to Brayden until she caught him cheating on her. Pepper helped Andi move past the hurt. After two weeks of crying and blaming, Andi decided to play the field. Andi decided to date any guy she wanted. Andi's coping mechanism became sexual. Andi chose successful, hot men to have sex with every weekend. Andi became a sex fiend due to the circumstances of Brayden cheating on her. Hence how she met Jackson. Jackson was a willing player of her game.

Andi worked at a cafe until she found a new job as an assistant at an architecture firm.

It was unnecessary to include the journal entries every other chapter in regards to how Andi spent her two weeks being depressed. I get it Andi you are wallowing in self pity. These would have served better as captions prior to starting the relationship with Jackson,

Andi was obsessed with financially stable business men claiming a successful man was more enticing and sexually satisfying. Andi was high off the knowledge that her looks and game playing skills were capabilities worthy of attracting men of Jackson's stature.

Andi used her body to attract men while inside she was insecure needing reassurance about her looks. Having successful good looking business men was not enough of an ego boost she had to seek attention with compliments from these same men.
Rolling my eyes at the antics that is Andi. Her weekend game is over and yet stomps away from Jacksons office pissed when he dismisses her at work.
I understand being depressed and hurt finding out your fianc cheated but making poor decisions only added to her problems. If Andi wanted to become a successful architecture partner than she needed to learn how to handle disappointment and rejection better.
Andi's character thrived off the attention she conjured from her friends. Andi got to peruse men at the bar to take advantage of sexually but when a man blatantly stared at her legs she spouted off, ""take a picture"", to him. Then referred to him as a pervert for looking when she always dressed to gain attention from men.

Everything could have been cleared up in the first book without the vague mysterious ending. There was barely any plot as it was in the first book. What could the second book possibly have as a plot (based on the ending)? Is Gabe being pursued by the Mafia and is also tied in with the CIA and he has a limp because theres a microchip in his knee that Russia uses to track him with? I would read it if that was the case and I bet tag this review as a huge spoiler.

Mandy has a list of rules. If these rules are kept then her heart will not be broken and she will live a life of solitude in content. Until one day, Gabe comes along and suddenly shes breaking one rule..and then them all.

Obviously this was going to be the plot of the book based on the synopsis, but it was written as if the author was as bored as I was while I was reading it. While I like to hear about people getting involved in their community, it was overdone in this book. Yes I understand that it was very important to Mandy, but why did it take over the whole entire story? Plus, if Mandy and Bailey are eighteen, why do their whole lives have to change if their Dad gets a new job? And speaking of their Dad, their Dad still deserves respect and not the utter disrespect that they give to him. If I was Gabe, that would set off warning bells.

The book just had a ton of unnecessary drama and cliche lines, example: The moment his fingers touched mine, there was an unexpected spark, a tiny snap that exploded between our handssomething took me by surprise and set my heart off on a wild cadence. I think Gabe felt it, too, because he jerked his hand away and examined the finger where his skin had touched mineHe sat there trying to pretend that spark wed both felt had been nothing more than static electricity, but I think we both knew better. Example B: I don't want to hear your explanation, I yelled louder, and my voice was strained from trying to scream over the roaring thunder. I don't want to hear anything you have to say, Gabe. I just want to walk away, go home, and forget I ever knew you.

Why is Gabe even interested in Mandy? I have yet to figure that out. Hes twenty-one and shes eighteen. Not a huge age gap, but their maturity levels are very far apart and Mandys actions makes it painfully obvious.

There were small errors that could have been easily fixed if a friend had proofread the book.

Hopefully that will be the end to this very detailed & probably accurately researched saga of the Revolutionary War.  You need to get past  lots of missing words & wrong tenses used, and a thoroughly disagreeable heroine, Hannah Corbett, a spoiled, overindulged, headstrong brat. Lets just say she matures over major tragedy in Book 1, The Cry for Freedom. Once that happens, the book becomes riveting as she becomes a Patriot spy but I cant help but mention that after reading a paragraph at the end of a chapter, I was shocked to see the words, The End.  WHAT, what?  So, I turned the page and found Book 2, Embrace of the Enemy, where I get reacquainted with Marcus, who may or may not be our hero. Hes a British officer, ruthlessly obsessed with her. Considering her driving need for revenge, I cannot understand why she would allow herself to become involved with him, but shes helpless to resist his kisses, etc. Bleh. Thankfully, you have several secondary characters weaving in and out, plus battle details with some actual quotes and insights, but Book 2 ends unsatisfactorily because this is a saga and the story continues with Book 3, Kiss of Deceit,  focusing on Hannahs brother, Dr. Jonathan Corbett.

(I was somewhat concerned that the dialogue might be a bit too boring, but it wasn't.) Hannah is a very determined woman. Stubborn in her own right, but has a fiery passion for the Patriot cause. When members of her family are attacked and killed, she sets out to find out who's behind it so she can plot her revenge. While I don't agree with everything she did in the book, I admire her courage and strength to see things through.

Jonathan strikes me as a man who loves his family, but has been dealt an unfair hand. A wife who betrayed him. A sister that he knows is in danger. A son he's barely seen. And he's a doctor attending to wounded and dying soldiers while trying to make sense of it all. It's an exhausting situation, mentally as well as physically. Like Hannah, I believe he tries to find some quiet strength to keep him going, but it's difficult.

While reading this book, I couldn't help but think that both figures must have felt entirely alone too much in their respective situations. A doctor dealing with all the demands of war and a spy trying to help the cause without putting too many lives, including her own, in danger.

This cozy mystery kept me guessing and even had me doubting my predictions. However, there were three cases of profanity, one expletive, a sarcastic remark about the Bible, and melodrama about affairs. I was also disappointed that the majority of the story was presented in explanations via dialogue. Though there were a couple of moments of action, I thought there could have been a much better balance between the action and dialogue to create a less tiresome atmosphere.

I was not compensated for my honest review.",Lack of Balance Between Dialogue and Action,2,7/27/2017
3067,4,A14DD838PVLI9H,B00ICXDRCU,"4 stars to [author:Elisabeth Crabtree|6574122]'s [book:The St. Valentine's Day Cookie Massacre|20815211], the first book in the ""Hatter's Cove Gazette"" mystery series. I downloaded this e-book for free several months ago and found myself with a few spare hours this evening... so I jumped on it and am glad I did. It was a really fun new series I look forward to reading more. I'll even check for other series by this author.

Kat Archer has taken a job at her local paper, hoping to get back into her investigative journalism career, but her new boss has put her on the food critic beat until he can hire more staff. After several bouts of food poisoning, and a few death threats, she worms her way into colleague Simon's news reporting to try and mentor him while finding better stories for herself. When her mother's best friend requests that Kat cover the new opening of her cookie shop, Kat has no choice but to comply. And by the time the party's over, she sees tons of gossip and feuds ripe for the picking. But it's when she tries to meet a snitch later that night that she finds her first dead body. And her mother's best friend is the prime suspect. As Kat tutors young Simon, deals with the arrival of a new detective she once new in Miami and finds herself attracted to her new boss, the paper's owner, she's about to crumble like the cookie. She narrowly escapes survival after weeding through several potential suspects and in the end finds herself with the culprit, and sent back to the food critic beat until they hire someone new!

For a debut cozy, it's really good. The plot and the complexity of the timeline in the crime is pretty organized and detailed... too many things have to add up for it to be each potential suspect, and someone has to be lying, but Kat can't figure out who it is. You can tell a lot of thought went into the relationships built between all the characters in order to make this work so well. And it really did.

Kat is likeable, a little annoying at times, but heading down the right path if she can keep her opinions in check from time to time. I like her budding friendships with her fellow colleagues at the paper. And her two potential love interests both have a nice shine to them.

It was a little too short and rushed at the end. I thought the author could have drawn out the suspense and the resolve for at least another 30 pages to really keep the reader guessing. But it was done well and I will definitely read another book in this series.

3069,5,A2UNMDJYXPEQZ3,B00ID2A1QA,"A stand alone read with a HEA.  This is a fun, entertaining read. I loved it and the HERO.  OMG he was all that and more.  The hero is a celebrity chef.  He is a big, gorgeous, yummy Hawaiian.  He has been roped into being in a celebrity auction.  He is not only gorgeous and sexy but quite real.  He is not attracted to all the women chasing him.  He likes a more laid back down to earth woman.  he doesn't sleep with every girl in town, he is willing to wait or do without.  He has agreed to prepare a dinner for the person that bids highest for him.  The money all goes to a charity.

The heroine is over 40 with two teen-age girls.  She has agreed to go to the auction and bid on a man for her friend.  His name is Todd and she doesn't know him at all.  So when Todd comes up for bids, she takes the bidding and wins him for her friend..  One problem, he is the wrong Todd.  What are the odds that two of the men would be named Todd?  He is a sexy bachelor that every woman in town wants a piece of.  she is over 40, 30 pounds overweight and has two teen girls.  No chance this will develop into anything.  Plus, she has only been divorced for a couple of years and she isn't sure she even wants it to turn into something.  Besides he is only 37, a few years younger than her.

This is a delightful romp as these two go back and forth with each other.  It is fun, romantic, entertaining and just leaves you feeling good.  I really enjoyed it and I definitely recommend it.  Only thing, the cover doesn't look like the hero at all to me!!  I pictured him as built like the Rock.  But, doesn't effect the storyline.

I read Irish Eyes, book number eight in Trocheck's Callahan Garrity series and enjoyed the story.  So I picked up another Callahan mystery, The Family Jewels.  What a disappointment!

The Family Jewels is not a novel, but a short storyand very short at that.  I think it took me less than 10 minutes to read.  Trocheck could have certainly fleshed out this plot a little more to at least make the story a novella.  My advice is to skip this one altogether.  Or at least, don't pay money to buy this book. I bought it on Amazon for less than a buck, and I still feel cheated.

3072,2,A19INPMOXPVJTK,B00IDD9V1U,"I had trouble deciding how to rate this book. The first half is very good. A few problems, such as a lot of grammar errors and a little too much purple prose (""he kissed like the devil""). But the characters were really enjoyable--I liked how stern and intimidating Eli was especially. The sex was hot and the BDSM scenes incredibly enjoyable. The author went hardcore with them, which I love; it can be hard to find books that delve deep into the Scene and this was great.

And then I got to the second half. This book gets dark. Very dark, and incredibly disturbing, and I wasn't prepared for that at all. Even more upsetting is the book summary DID NOT WARN FOR THIS AT ALL. I'm not talking about the BDSM, again that was great. But there are graphic mentions of severely traumatizing past events that literally made me nauseous, and it's irresponsible for the author to not warn for it at all. It would have been easy to do without spoiling the plot, and I would never ever have bought the book if I'd known how dark it gets.

Spoilers below:

Eli was in a horrendous car accident several years ago. Three of his friends were killed, one of them being his boyfriend. Not only was his leg mangled, he was left with severe PTSD. I suspected it would be pretty bad based on the summary, so it didn't bother me that much. Though he does have a few episodes where he flashes back, and they're pretty bad. I could handle it, though, and it made Eli feel much more human and sympathetic.

Justin's past is where it gets bad, though. See, he escaped from an incredibly abusive relationship a few years ago. Literally escaped, as in waited for his boyfriend to fall asleep and then ran out of the house in nothing but the clothes on his back. There's mentions of it throughout the book, but they're subtle at first, slowly increasing in intensity. Then Eli and Justin are in a scene--one that Justin specifically asked for, so it was consensual--and he gets triggered. Big time. I have no problem with that type of situation, even enjoy it at times because when romance is involved it can make my heart ache in a good way. But this book takes it way too far in my opinion. Justin doesn't just bolt from the scene, he flees from Eli instantly transferring all the hatred from his abuser onto Eli, suddenly turning him from a lover to a monstrous enemy (Eli never pushes Justin into anything, or manipulates him, this is totally a trigger from his past, which makes it slightly redeemable). Eli turns into a wallowing, pitiful mess, which doesn't quite feel believable and honestly made me like him less.

Later on, when they try to patch things up (which feels really, really unbelievable given how terribly wrong things went), both men describe in detail their pasts. Justin's ex-boyfriend is a textbook example of what Dom's should never do in their relationships. There was a lot of physical, emotional and sexual abuse and late in the story Justin goes into very graphic detail. It just went too far for me and wound up really spoiling the rest of what started out as a really good book. It's a shame, because it started out so promising, but if you decide to pick it up, just know that it is not the typical light and fluffy romance novel--it gets into deep territory, far deeper than I felt comfortable with. And the HEA just seemed completely forced and unrealistic given both men's personalities, especially Eli's.",An enjoyable book that becomes deeply disturbing,4,3/12/2016

Its OFFICE PLACE Romance. Its CHANCE MEETING/SECOND CHANCE Romance. Its KINKY Romance (which I was NOT expecting, but delighted me beyond measure).

Sam and Michael were superbly drawn characters with the perfect balance of flaws and ultimate growth when they were able to get out of their own way. They each had a lot of inner demons to face in order to get to that HEA and I kind of wish theyd done more of that work together. Ultimately, though, they fit in magnificent ways and are the perfect cornerstone couple for future books in the series.

He may be the newest member of the crew but Captain Baltsaros and First Mate Tom also learn and grow, not always forward but life is that way, three steps forward and two steps back.

I'm doing an overall series review because this is not a tale where you can read just one, Baal's Heart is a package deal and trust me, it's a package you won't want to return.  Don't get me wrong, it is not all sunshine and roses, this is a tale of filled with darkness and grit but that does not mean there is no happiness and triumph because it is chock full of all of it.  This is not for the faint-of-heart, much of the boys' journey may be hard to take, good and bad, but for me it was worth it.

Jon, Tom, and Baltsaros' relationship is more than just a mnage or threesome, it is a complicated, messy at times, unsure, but a relationship from the heart for sure.  The sexy times are off the charts, the heat is just short of starting your Kindle, Nook, or paperback ablaze.  This journey is a tale of so much more than just sex and passion, there is plenty of drama, violence, piracy, backstabbing, underhandedness, but there is also lots of friendship, compassion, and plain heart.

I'm a sucker for Bey Deckard's writing. You see, I'm late to the party. I started in reverse. I read his most recent works first, and I'm now making my way through his back list. For an author who has only been publishing for a relatively short amount of time, Mr. Deckard is a force to be reckoned with. He is phenomenally talented, and I'm delighted he's decided to share his talent with the world.

Caged is not my type of book, but somehow that doesn't matter because I was lured in. I mentioned I'm working my way through his back list, right? This author can do no wrong when it comes to crafting a tale. I'm not a fan of pirates nor historicals, but once I jumped feet first into this read, NONE OF IT MATTERED.

Caged is the story of Jon, a young man who has an unusual talent. He has insight into people. His stepfather Reginald is sort of a dic... umm not so nice person. He uses Jon's talent for his personal gain. Little does he know, someone else has his sights set on Jon. Enter Captain Baltsaros. This guy. This guy is a mayjah jerkkkkkkkk! He's also hooking up with one of his crew members, Tom. By hooking up, I totally am referring to having da sexz. Did I mention this book is better than one of the messiest soap operas?

And the romances are humorous, sweet, and satisfying.  All four are romantic but the first two are more distinctly funny, while the last two are funny but touching and poignant at the same time.

It gives you tips on how to get to know your top toddler and breaks it down to what the book refers to as the three different types of Toddlers and how you know which one you have. It covers the adventure, the easy going and the shy toddler. It tells you the difference in each child and which ones need more structure or discipline etc..

This book reiterate the need to calm down over an over again before you discipline the child which I can agree with a hundred percent. Whichever way you discipline your child you should always be calm when you do it. This book also explains the need for deciding on discipline with everyone around your child weather be your husband or grandparents and why everyone needs to be on the same page if you want it to work.

Improvements

There are a few spelling errors that need to be fixed on page 39 it says teach toddlers the compliment by first complimenting them. Tell them they're outfit is cut, or they are pretty, or think them for their good behavior.  Cut obviously be in the mist take care that should have been spelled cute.

Then there are the six pages dedicated to why spanking is bad,  I have six boys and spanking is not my  personal way I discipline my children, but to dedicate so many pages to one subject, I think there should be less on why it's not the best choice and more on other choices you can make. There are only ten pages on how to properly discipline. I understand that the author obviously feel strongly on the subject and I agree in Park as a parent who doesn't spank, but I could have given all the reasons why you shouldn't in a page. I feel it is more important to focus our attention on giving parents more tools so they don't feel the need to spank or have less instances where they feel they need to do that.

Conclusion- as much as I enjoyed reading the book and it was a nice little refresher, I couldn't give this book 5 stars because  the six pages on spanking was just a little extreme, but overall there is some really good advice in here. I would love to see the author add more tools for parents to use and cut those 6 pages down.

3081,2,A2UKA0EBAK98H6,B00IEGOITG,"This book reminds me more of a letter one would receive from a well-meaning great-aunt who doesnt actually have any kids of her own but she knows how you should raise yours. It is filled with vague advice with a few nuggets of actual insight.

The good:
Most of what I am counting as good advice is actually common sense. Be calm when disciplining, talk to your child, be consistent, get to the root of the problem etc. But these were overshadowed for me by the many things that I either personally don't agree with or that I know experts disagree with completely.

The bad:
Yeah, this book does need a good editor. Im not really one to judge, but if you are publishing a book I would think that youd want to go over it with a fine toothed comb

Some things I don't care for, but you will find that with any parenting book. But things like teaching them that if you are good you will get rewarded only leads to issues later on in life. I just talked about this issue last week with someone who holds a phd in mental illness (I don't remember her exact specialty in psychiatry, forgive me)

A good portion of the book deals with spanking and while I myself do not believe in spanking I thought that this chapter was overkill and filled with opinion masked as facts. I would like to see some actual numbers that back what she says, because from what I know on this subject does not match what she claims.

She talks about calming down before disciplining your child by taking a walk around the block or singing softly to yourself. That would be great if toddlers didn't have the attention span of a gnat. They would have no clue why you were disciplining them!

The ugly:
Some of it was a little insulting. For example, A good parent knows exactly when and how to discipline a child. Ive known many excellent parents who struggle with how to discipline, especially since you can read 2 books from two different experts who have two opposing views. And quite frankly, what works one day with a toddler doesnt necessarily work the next.

She talks about the different types of toddler personalities and at one point in describing the easy going toddler she advises that a parent shouldnt forget that they are there since they are so easily overlooked. If you need to be told not to forget that your child exists, you have bigger issues than this book can handle.

She has some high expectations of toddler capabilities. Im sorry, but when dealing with a 1-3 year old (the ages she suggested this book is for) you cannot expect a toddler who is clinging to you as you are trying to leave to explain I am afraid that someone might hurt me.

Anyway, as much as I hate being negative of someone elses work I really cant say that I liked this book at all. There was no solid techniques discussed, just her reasoning for why discipline is important. No studies to back up her research. It didn't seem to me as though she had any actual experience with children. The above examples are only a few of the ones I found problematic. I won't be recommending this to people.

3083,1,A2RFOSYFXNVNTT,B00IFEMVHI,"For fiction, the reader agrees to suspend their disbelief in the original premise of the story, then the characters act and react normally to this premise.  In this book, there are simply disjointed situations loosely tied together by a purported story line.  The characters do not resemble real people and their reactions aren't typical.

Starting with the worst first, there is the scene in which the Heroine bursts into the bathroom a few minutes after the Hero enters the bathroom and is appalled to find him masturbating.  When is the last time YOU burst into a bathroom that you knew held another adult?  Im not sure I would have been happier to see the adult voiding or defecating, surely the other options for a bathroom run.  For this scene to work the adult must NOT lock the bathroom door, despite having a number of young children and strangers in the house AND there must be adequate time to begin the process.  Furthermore, despite the clear indication that the hero wants to be alone, the heroine must disregard any requested boundaries and force her way into the bathroom.  YUCK.  And NO, just NO.  It is one thing to be on the heels of someone and open a door slammed in your face, and an entirely different thing to wait a few minutes and follow another adult into a bathroom.

While that scene was the worst I read, I must admit I could not finish this book as neither the heroine nor the hero were particularly endearing, and being a romance, the ending is known.  I also missed the memo that says that being a short woman is something that I should feel is a disadvantage.  This heroine wears heels in every situation because she is vertically challenged.  When you wear heels in a barn, you are not vertically challenged, you are mentally challenged.  The author sometimes recognizes that the heroine is being dumb, and provides an explanation.  Here it was because she wore tennis shoes to the gym.  The author skipped why that meant that tennis shoes aren't appropriate for a barn, but heels are.

This book bills itself as the first in a series, but the characters are part of a prior book from the author, which I must have thought was good enough to buy a second book.  Unfortunately, this book is pretty awful.",Someone Lend Me a Gun!,6,1/12/2016

I understand author's want to reel you in and I can respect that if it is disclosed in the summary but I expected a solid ending either a HEA or something not a to be continued.  Yes I knew it was part of a series however since there was indication that it was a cliffhanger I assumed the other books in the series were spun off this one with characters that we were introduced in this one.  Perhaps I am old school but when I see a book is part of a series I don't assume cliffhanger I assume that characters in the first book will make an appearance in the additional stories but each story is a stand alone, I am learning that this is generally not the case with many books now and that is a shame.

The angst of both characters is over developed and a bit overly dramatic and there was certainly a bit overboard on the ""your so hot"" etc but nothing that I couldn't live with.  There was some inconsistencies...the time apart was it two weeks or two months?  Using ""her"" when ""he"" should have been used nothing too terrible just stuff that should have been caught with another edit check for continuity.  In all honestly the only reason I regret the time I spent with the book is because of that dreaded cliff hanger, I want to know the end of the story but much like Lilly I am stubborn and I feel used.  I haven't figured out if it is worth giving in to read the final two.

I believe that whole grains are essential, but I would like a little more detail into what you consider whole. I argued with the Whole Grain Council who advertise on the Cheerios boxes. This could be suspect. They think that removing bran from the wheat or oats or any grain still allows for it to be considered ""whole grain"". I disagree. The grain is made up of 3 parts: bran, germ, and endosperm. Manufacturers have gotten very good at separating all 3 now, that has been leaving consumers confused about what makes whole grain ever since. This book covers everything very loosely from diet to exercise even. It was a quick read through before getting to the recipes. If you want more detail about clean eating, then this book won't cover the detail. They assume that GMO is fine, because it's not even mentioned.

3097,3,A386UI78AQB5P8,B00IJFYICO,"Pretty good - the rights notes are hit with the main scenes, and I enjoyed Annie's personality. As for Heath...not so much.

I think a big part of the problem was all the telling. Except for the Big emotional scenes, I never felt the hero's love for Annie. We're told he loves her, and he helps her out when her son is hurt, but all he does is sit in his office and thinks, and doesn't DO anything to earn her love. I'm trying to figure out why she loves him, because their three months' long friendship was more told than shown.

It didn't help that there was a double-standard. Heath (the hero) got to have a sexual affair with a girl he didn't love, while Annie just dated a doctor, again, Heath didn't do a damned thing other than arrange a flight and hotel room and demand she stop dating the other guy. Why?  And why a sex scene with the Other Woman and not one with his real love? I don't get that - is sex with an older woman not desirable in a romance novel?

This was good. Could have been better. I like two tropes used - second chances and friends-to-lovers - but a deeper POV would have been better with less telling. And having the hero actually work to win his lady's love. The climax was disappointing.",Good...,5,4/28/2017

That's not to imply that it's a bad book at all, far from it, actually. The quality of the writing is pretty good, the characters are realistic, and there's a very sweet HEA on horizon even if the book ends with an ominous teaser for the next book in the series.

That teaser and the fact that I found the story itself to be kind of boring and Heath frustrating was the reason for the lower star rating. I don't mind dense guys that eventually come around, but I do mind ones that avoid for so long that they let their intended doubt them and then don't communicate because they get all prideful. Same with the other person in the romantic relationship, if they cut off communication when there's no good reason to do so, I get real annoyed. That happened here and it just made their relationship both realistic and too frustrating for me to root for.

Heres an indication of the authors skill: as I read the first book, which is told in the first person P.O.V. and is that of a young woman, I did not question her authenticity, not even when I looked at the cover again and noticed the author is a man.  I was so impressed by his conveyance of the persona of a young woman that I wondered if the author was in fact a woman using a male pen name, or perhaps he was of the male gender only in name.  But no, he has a wife and kids, so what this looks like is the use of finely tuned observational talent and impressive writing skill.

The second indication of strong skill became more evident to me the deeper I got into the first books plot, and the second books, and the third books.  What becomes increasingly clear is that the author is good at creating and telling stories.  One tell-tale of this is when the reader is curious about subplots and secondary characters that ordinarily would not interest him.  This talent is much more rare than being able to write a nicely crafted sentence or paragraph.  His wording is not fancy, so his imagery and thoughts flow into your brain without you noticing them until they're there, which is how it should be and is much easier to describe than to do.

Any book, especially one that involves fantasy, requires some degree of suspension of disbelief.  That comes from you, the reader, but is enabled mostly by the writer.  The reader can pick apart and find fault in any story or even any sentence, but a good writer prevents that by keeping the reader caught up in the story.  In these books, this author does that.

I like Sienna. She reads like a real 18-year-old. However, she doesn't react like I imagine a girl who never went into public until she was nearly 18 would. For this reason alone, I have a hard time imagining her as the savior of the world (which reading the descriptions of the other 7 titles in this series, I believe she single-handedly becomes at the end of the series).
I found the revelation of the ""someone else"" point of view character at the end to be somewhat unbelievable. Too many of the segments from that narrator read like a churlish young adult not a well-trained adult agent. However, it did explain the amazing fighting skills and meta powers. I had mixed feelings about a buy-in.
I did look into purchasing this series. However, I don't see these novella-length stories meriting $5 a pop. (My opinion) Since they seem to run continuously, I think sets of omnibuses (like the one I got for free that contains the first three books) would be a better deal financially. And I read a 10-book series of similar length and pace from Morgan Rice and those were $2 each. In this case, Mr. Crane priced me out of his readership.",Book Three makes this omnibus worth reading,23,6/25/2016

3117,5,ASQNI7CQW96S2,B00IK6BE6U,"Recently, I reviewed several disappointing cookbooks.  Not so, with this one.  The author took the time to not only develop the recipes, but to put together a lovely book with, that a joy to read and one Ill go back to over and over.  The pictures alone, have you salivating and wanting those desserts.  My goal has always been to make my gluten free foods as tasty as their glutinous counterparts.  Because of my dietary demands, I have to alter practically every recipe I come across.  That makes no difference, because these recipes still all came out delicious.  The ones I tried were really good.

The book is broken into sections for different types of desserts.  I tried a couple of the cakes recipes and made microwave cakes out of them.  I also made some cookies and they were good.

Because I have Celiac Disease, Crohns, Diabetes and Lactose Intolerance, plus I have Multiple Allergies (some severe) I have to change a lot of recipes around.  I have a MAJOR allergy to GUAR GUM.  Because guar gum is Cheap, companies use it in nearly everything, (ice cream, cream cheese, some yogurts, salad dressings, mayonnaise,  hot cocoa, pudding, etc.)  If I acidentally get anything with it in it, I get horrible sores on the back of me, that lasts for weeks and have to go to the dermatologist.  That means medicines, lotions and being in pain for weeks.  Being allergic to guar beans is a common allergy for some Celiacs.  Yet, a lot of companies that make gluten free foods put it in their foods.  UDIS gluten free bread has it.  Not realizing a company would put it in a gluten free product (thats on me, for not reading all the ingredients)  I ate two slices.  Another trip to the dermatologist and 5 weeks in pain and bleeding sores.  ARGH!!!

So, as great as these recipes are, I have to adapt them to fit my needs.  That doesnt always work great.  A recipe has to be able to hold its own, to be converted to artificial sweeteners and not use cream cheese (cant have the guar gum)  Ive learned to replace the guar gum called for in recipe books with xanthum and other gums, so thats not a problem.  Ive also leaned that Greek yogurt is an excellent substitute for cream cheese, but its best to add a bit of acid to it, like lemon or apple cider vinegar and a teaspoon of xanthum gum.  Then, it taste almost identical to cream cheese in baking.  People that are lactose intolerant, can almost always tolerate a certain amount of Greek Yogurt, because nearly all the whey has been removed and with it the lactose.

This book is jut full of delicious recipes.  Taken as is, or like me if you have to adapt them to your diet.  Thank you for reading.",  SOME REALLY GOOD RECIPES AND A PLEASURE TO READ ,4,12/4/2016
3118,5,A30L23E8H151S7,B00IKJ9ZH2,"I really enjoyed reading this book by Eliza Gayle! This is book one in her Pleasure Playground series and I am in love with it!

Eve is a office assistant at Altered Ego-a fetish photography studio. Eve is very much interested in the two men, Chase and Murphy, who run the business, after she's viewed some of their photography sessions from the shadows. When an order comes in that requests a plus-size woman with red hair, Eve knows this is her chance to be noticed by the two men who she believes could bring her to sexual heights she's only dreamed of.

I really liked Eve and felt her sorrow from her past that rears it's head time and time again. She knew what she wanted and I give her credit for pulling up those panties and going for it. It is apparent both Chase and Murphy have feelings for Eve that they have kept to themselves. When she suggested she do the photo shoot, Murphy jumped at the chance. Chase was a harder sell. It was because he was still screwed up in the head over his last menage relationship not panning out. I loved the dynamic of Murphy doing the scene and Chase setting it up and photographing it. He really felt for Eve and didn't want to ultimately hurt her in any way. What happens when the intense intimacy leaves lasting feelings for the threesome? Can they come to terms with the chemistry they have never felt with anyone else before?

I listened to this audiobook and loved the narrator Gregory Salinas. He was very expressive and captured all three characters perfectly. I never felt like it was rushed or didn't know who was speaking. He was very captivating to listen to!

This was such an attention getter from the beginning and it is a perfect intro to the new Pleasure Playground series. I definitely will be checking out future books!

However, the romance story lines of the individual stories were shaky, in my opinion. I found most of the characters pretty likable, but the female MCs were....eh. A thought they came off kind of flat, annoying at times, and almost too similar in their attitudes and reactions to things.

Back to the romance parts - they also came off feeling rushed and forced. Not really quite believable and had they been kept to a minimum, I think the books would have been better off in some ways.

Having survived an accident that put me in a wheelchair for nearly a year myself, I couldn't imagine going through the experience in a non-handicap-accessible time.  I liked the way the author touched, but didn't dwell on the medical issues facing an amputee, before the days of microsurgery, physical therapy, and bionic prosthetics.  Instead, she focused on the obstacles encountered, things that ambulatory people take for granted, like the threshold of a door.  I feel that was an excellent way to handle the situation, by putting the focus on the flaws in the accessibility of the world , rather than on the handicap of the character.

The other huge issue she tackled was of course, that of racism, bigotry, and prejudice, and how they not only divided a country, but also ripped families apart.

Id gotten the first three books of this series just sitting there, and once I start, Im compelled to keep going.

I think Id recommend this series for those who are way into the romance, and just want a touch of the MC life. To paraphrase Wedding Crashers,

I'm sure you'd love to be free, maybe go out and meet some biker guy that can  make you feel dangerous but also safe.

THATs this series in a nutshell. Yes, theres some questionable women and some danger, but overall, its a comfort kind of read. The WTF-ery level is a 2, at most. The downsides are that alot of the action that leads to the danger, the actual MC stuff, happens off-page because its strictly first person POV from the individual heroines.

Cole and Scarlet - While theres some insta-love, they don't automatically dive into bed and theres some good twists to the usual takes on the genre when it comes to the sweetbutts, which I liked. Overall, a good start.

Readers are a little bored with Ashley's repetitive story lines and dialogue, so this book, which is a pale imitation of Ashley's Motorcycle Man is even weaker.

Earth has recovered from almost destroying itself. Humans have begun colonizing the nearest planets when a means of faster than light travel enables exploration of planets farther away. This leads to the discovery of the existence of an energy signal located inside of a sterilized planet. Further investigation uncovers an alien library left by a race of beings called the Saiph. Their language is deciphered and humanity learns that it is a seeded race, one among just a few, whose DNA was influenced by the Saiph in an effort to leave something of themselves before the enemy they called the Others exterminated them. Earth's collective forces, now in the form of a republic, determine that it's best move would be to use the newly discovered technology in the Saiph library to create a larger and more militaristic space fleet to determine if the Others still exist and also the status of the other seeded races.

New ships and their crews are sent out on specific paths to find out if mankind has any five fingered cousins. The good news is that some are existing at different levels of development. The bad news is that the Others are still roaming around, for unknown reasons, bent on killing off any planet whose technology reaches a certain level.

The way humans use the new technology they come across is fascinating because they are not fighting over it. The near extinction experience has tempered their need to win at any cost although the politicians are still at each other's throats.

The descriptions of the space ships in terms of size didn't help me to visualize them I'm afraid but every thing else was great. There was even a little romance. I am off to read the second book and would invite anyone to read this series with me.",Excellent reading.,4,5/17/2017

Young girls and boys stolen from homes and sold on the open market for paedophiles to practice their wishes in dungeons of evil. The highest in the land, judges, politicians and well organised groups of foster parents, plus bureaucrats litter the landscapes.

The author well illustrates the sordid scenes that envelop the reader and makes sure this book won't be closed until the very absolute end. This is a battle between good and evil. Each page reveals never ending horror at the resources available to the leaders who are snatching innocent children from the streets.

3153,3,A1U9ZD4AZ5FNIT,B00ING5PN0,"""Fever: a Blood Moon Rising Werewolf Romance"" by Lola Taylor is a wolf shifter romance and the first this reader has read from the writer. Characters were not fully developed, but developed enough to get an idea of those whose path we are traveling along - although this reader must admist alppha male Gage 'seemed' blonde in this reader's eyes and she was quite surprised when a reference to him being 'dark' later popped up. Protagonist Danica had her quirky moments that are giggle-worthy, and as she began to understand this new life that had been tossed at her, she began to show more spine, albeit often acting like a stereotypical somewhat spineless female for the most part. New packmaster Gage was shown to have heart, yet a pack that did not trust him - albeit due to their previous packmasters cruelty - and was not shown the respect deserved for his position. His pack refused to follow him without a direct alpha order, which goes against the grain of were shifter romances and wolves in general... they are pack animals and that is always an underlying theme in were shifter stories. Underdeveloped characters and traits that go against wolf temperament made it difficult for this reader to empathize for or with any character.

There were some minor spelling, grammar and punctuation errors, but not enough to toss one from the story. Settings were described well enough to easily visualize; dialogue between characters seemed authentic to each character. Taylor slipped into 'telling' versus 'showing' every now and then, but as this reader stated - she did show more than enough to visualize where we were traveling in the world she created, and enough character description to gain a rough idea of what each individual looked like... her wraiths were interesting! This reader found the beginning descriptions of the witches to be somewhat stereotypical, especially with the entire 'good versus evil' theme weaved into them. Taylor's voice was inviting and caught this reader quickly, yet she never truly fulfilled the promise of the story... this reader lost faith in the story teller and felt the tale did not live up to its earlier promise.

While the romance between Gage and Danica, a happily ever after (HEA) ending did happen, the book itself ended on a bit of a cliffhanger concerning an impending war and exactly who wanted to kill Danica. So, some major questions left unanswered... this reader truly dislikes cliffhanger endings when not warned or made aware of them in advance, so is deducting a star for that reason. Intimate moments started off fairly sensual between Gage and Danica, but to be fully mated at their mating ritual, they had to have sex in front of the entire pack. This reader isn't in to voyeurism but that wasn't the true issue... the scene was so rushed and glossed over, it was downright boring. This story had the potential of a four-star read, but midway that potential dropped and was never regained... while it is better than a two-star read, this reader felt a three-star and small recommendation would fit.",Great potential but quickly fell flat,3,6/5/2017
3154,2,A3HEG0QCOK446R,B00ING5PN0,"New to this author and well its an ok read but I had a few issues with this book.  For one thing an Alpha of a pack no matter how new he is deserves respect.  This pack though?  They had major distrust and I understand their previous Alpha was a bastard but still to not help go after his mate?  Thats just a whole lot of disrespect there.  When packs get attacked or go to war sometimes people die and they needed to realize that.  He took complete responsibility for it but they needed to be a little more supportive.  Those wolves who died during the Wraith attack knew what they were getting into and still went.  It just goes against the grain of what I know about Alphas and packs and the hierarchy.  I have read hundreds of books and this is the first time a pack has treated their alpha and his mate this way.  Just seems wrong.  Another issue I had was well their intimate moments.  They got interrupted 3 times...once or twice even I can understand but 3?  Thats pushing it and became annoying the 3rd time.  Then when it came to actually mating?  That left a lot to be desired.  It was boring!  The times they ""almost"" was way hotter than their mating.  Also, how the hell is she ok with doing the dirty in front of all the pack?  Especially when they have no respect for their Alpha?  Its like oh by the way we gotta do the dirty in front of everyone and she's like oh ok.  Now I have read books where that is the norm.  Thats not what I mean.  You would think she'd freak out a little.  She was nervous of course but I'd be throwing a s*** fit yo!  The books I have read where they do the mating sex in front of the pack the female takes issue and freaks.  Eventually gives in but come on!  I really like how it started and I think my main issues were with about the middle of the book and on.  A little disappointing BUT I enjoyed the story.  This was free but I am not sure if I will be buying the rest of the series.  Although its an ok read I'd really like to rate a 4 star in order to buy and this just wasn't a 4 star for me.

For example, how can the female protagonist, in a few scenes prior, promise to be always be there for the male only to later think of leaving because she was scared of forever. Or how can she be thinking he might leave her someday after he had just said the bond was forever and was trying to get her to commit.",Poor Plot.,4,4/16/2017
3156,5,AL4CJITRALYBU,B00INIYG5G,"My three-year-old twins love the Little Owl books so when we heard Little Owl's Day during story time, I knew we would be adding it to our library! At the time, the board book edition was not available and, since my kids are still in the slightly destructive, toddler age, I decided to wait for it. I'm so glad we did because it has already been a hit in our household! If you are familiar with Little Owl's Night, the board book version is printed in a similar style. They both have the same number of pages and the books are also the same size so they look nice on a bookshelf together. This book is also printed on thick, durable pages that are perfect for the toddler era.

The story in this book is really great for kids and makes it fairly easy for them to understand. Each page has a couple sentences so it's not too much and not too little of a story. Little Owl's Day is the story of Little Owl and the animals he sees during the day. He normally isn't awake during the day but he is woken up by a noisy squirrel and can't go back to sleep. He decides to explore his surroundings and see all of the animals who are sleeping at night when he is awake. Some of the same animals in Little Owl's Night appear in this book so children get to see what those animals do during the day.

I think Little Owl's Day is a wonderful book for young children and, if they like Little Owl's Night, they will most likely enjoy this one as well. My kids already love it and we like to read both before bedtime. Little Owl's Day isn't necessarily a bedtime book but the story ends at nighttime so you can definitely use this for bedtime. If you read Little Owl's Day and Little Owl's Night one after the other, they will help paint a picture for children about what Little Owl does during the cycle of the day. We often read these books before bedtime and I see us enjoying this one for a long time. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a good book for a young child!",Another Fantastic Little Owl Book for Our Children's Library!,13,2/10/2016

I was excited about the characters and storyline, but it seemed to just stop going the way it started to a turn that didn't fit the characters she made me start loving. The happy parents become sad. The hulking hero gets a devastating diagnosis and doesn't recover. Areas are left untold. The heroine is shown as happy to be the strong, leader to her hero that loves her, but it just completely missed what it could have been and where it was leading. If it needed to end this way, then start with a jerk that needed a tragedy to make him rethink life and change. That was not these characters. This book truly had the opportunity to be wonderful. I guess that's why I'm so disappointed. Lorcan, the main character, had the perfect qualities to be a great hero, yet she took him down a path that I don't read fiction to find. I read historical, romantic, fiction to escape, not to read about someone with a devastating accident that doesn't heal. For me, it ended missing the great elements she started developing.

Just about the time I decided to put it down, the writing got a little better - it was almost as if two people were writing the book.  I understand William's desire to leave the life he was being forced into by the death of his brother, Henry, and thought the second life he entered into was a good twist.  William, however, came off as almost stupid in the way he just up and thought he could get away with leading a second life.  Then,  when he actually married in his faked life, things got a little ridiculous. I thought his solution to ending his problem with the fire was very selfish and not at all a satisfactory step toward the ending, especially for a man who was supposed to be good-hearted.  The actual end, though, was pretty good.  The whole book left me wondering why Mabbot and Sara were even written into the story except as to maybe just create more tension in the plot.

The abuse escalates and she plans her escape; it is a good thing because he came home drunk and tied to kill her.

She leaves in their car, ditches the car, takes a taxi to a bus station and then heads south until she sees a used car lot and gets a junker to continue her journey. Leaving the Interstate behind she ends up looking for a cup of coffee in a small town bar.

Jackson Beaumont, bar owner, musician, a pre-law graduate and ex-cop and P.I. is just the man she needs to help her find her freedom from the abusive husband she is trying to escape from. Jackson is so helpful, considerate and patient with the young beautiful Lena as she heals from the beating she received before she escaped Troy.

The emotions and handling of an abusive situation with consideration and caring for the details to get Lena free make Jackson a super nice man besides being a hot musician. I loved how he treated Lena with so much care and patience while she learned to stand on her feet again. The happy ending was nice too.",Beautifully Wounded ~ The Beaumont Brothers ~ Book 1,3,10/10/2017
3168,3,AYX7NDW98SKFC,B00IPOCDXU,"Lena has been married for about one year, but in that time she's learned some awful unspeakable things about her husband. It is eventually to the point that she doesn't  have a friend she can turn to in a desperate time of need. Relying solely on her own strength and quick thinking, one night she learns what she is capable of. Hurt bad, and in need of putting some distance between her and her abusive husband,  Lena ends up a few hours out of town. Seeking some refuge & recuperation,  Lena ends up  in Jackson's bar.

Almost straight away Jackson can see that this woman is in rough shape. He offers her the vacant guest housing at he & his brother's place. With plenty of hesitation on Lena`s part, she eventually agrees.  If she stays hidden, whoever she's running from won't catch up with her. Slowly building up some trust between them,  Lena can start coming back into herself.

I appreciated that the book had a strong beginning,  because without that the story would crumble.  The timeline of the love story doesn't add up. With all the emotional scarring & baggage,  Lena wouldn't be so open to trusting again. Aside from Jackson`s heady pursuit of her, he is overly generous, patient & willing for Lena to come out of her shell again. And when her ex tracks her down suddenly,  will Lena be able to take her newfound wit with her and still be able to trust in Jackson to take care of her?","3 1/2 stars, Romantic suspense!",3,8/13/2017
3169,1,A1825GF4MPES5T,B00IPOCDXU,"This was so unrealistic it brought the story down. Lena escaped a year being an abused wife, thought she killed her husband, yet she's open with Jackson from day one? More so at day two and telling all of her business? There was no believability, which having more time progression would've given it. Jackson isn't a very likable guy with how he's pursuing Lena when she's just out of that abusive relationship, only two weeks pass and he's kissing her after all the he knows she needs time and he's going to give her that time self musings he does.
Lena had severely bruised ribs, yet she was crouching down to pet on Jackson's dog, bending down to pick up the cat that followed, but she had difficulty moving and taking deep breaths just before this. Later she's helping lift Jackson's boat to carry it to the water, and it's only been about a week later and she was just holding her side due to discomfort?
Character age of Jackson made ZERO sense with the timeline of events the author wrote. He's 22 years old, yet it's written he completed college (which he started at 17 and did four years), decided to be a cop instead of going on to law school, so completed the academy and worked as one for a while (doesn't say how long, but minimum age for departments is 21 to enter the academy and the academy is typically around 6-8 months), decided it wasn't for him, went into the P.I. business, doing that for a bit (again doesn't say how long), then his uncle passed away a year ago and he's had the bar since. How in ANYONE'S logic does all this fit into Jackson being only 22, turning 23 in a couple months?! IT DOESN'T!! Not even later when the author writes he graduated high school at 16, and went straight into college, especially since it was previously written that he was a freshmen in college at 17.
I didn't feel the relationship between Lena and Jackson, there was not much in the way of relationship building. Lena's involvement with Jackson lacked believability. Her responses to him with her very present history was too unrealistic. Jackson was a good guy, but it just doesn't work.
Her friend just shows up, saying her other friend found her. How? It made absolutely no sense that she was able to be found by them. None. That clich happened to be in that small town the very day Lena goes into town the first time ever is ridiculous. Her abusive husband made her cut all ties, so why would this friend say all that was said to Troy? Made less sense Troy finding her.
Jackson had police training and even spoke about teaching Lena self-defense, yet he couldn't overpower and subdue Troy? Seriously?

3170,2,A3OGOPDK5J7BBP,B00IPOCDXU,"Im not exactly sure how I feel about this book. As a domestic violence survivor I find it hard to believe that not only did Lena trust Jackson so easily but was so sexually aware of him. That should be the last thing on her mind. I know it was for me. Also the author did not go beyond the surface of Lenas feelings and thoughts about her situation. Being that the book is based around domestic violence and escape from it you would think there would have a lot more depth. There is so more to a situation like this than what the author went into. Again just touching the surface. Sometimes just the thought. It was disheartening.

Jackson is way and I mean way to good to be true. His character just wasn't realistic. There are people out there that are really good and help people in Lenas situation but they are not completely perfect and have all the resources at their fingertips like Jackson. Not believable.

I just couldn't connect with the characters. Which is strange being that I once was in Lenas shoes. I had high hopes for this book so much so that I one clicked the remaining two books after reading the blurb and some of the reviews but was extremely let down in the end.

Jackson and his brother Brodie inherited a bar and house from their uncle in Northern California. The way they love and respect each other and carry on with their lives, each bringing what's necessary to keep the business alive, is wonderful. Jackson and Brodie are also talented musicians and part of the success of the bar is due to their band. When Lena stops in, obviously wounded, Jackson steps in unable to resist helping her, as his naturally protective demeanor rises again.

Beautifully Wounded is a terrific book that grabs you emotionally and I highly recommend it!

I have read all John Heldts Northwest Passage Time Travel stories.  Rather than provide a synopsis on each and every one, Im instead going to simply state my assessment of these novels as a whole and include it as a review on each one of the of the series.

Every story is about traveling into the past and setting the stage for the future.  If you like time-travel, youll love this series.  If I had to pick my favorite, for now I think The Journey would be it, but thats just me.

Every story is a stand-alone novel.  Occasionally there will be a subtle reference to one of the other novels, but that too is sufficiently explained to make it germane to the current story without requiring one to read any of the other stories.

Because every story is stand-alone, they don't have to be read in any order.  However, reading them in the sequence of being written will enable the reader to make most of the connections no matter how subtle they are.  (The Journey is the only one that doesnt appear tie in to the others  unless I missed something.)

What impresses me the most is how the author managed to tell five different stories, yet have them tie together in so many subtle ways.  How was he able to keep track of everything?  And, bless his heart, he doesnt introduce too many characters to keep track of (I hate getting most of the way through a novel only to wonder whos Fred? when he shows up long after being forgotten by myself).

The only negative? comment I might make is that the protagonists exercise wisdom way beyond their age when dealing with others.  And, thats not really a negative, but a wish that I might have shown such wisdom at that age instead of acquiring it the hard way.",Northwest Passage Series,9,2/9/2016

Both Mia and Sean needed to figure out their place in life. Mia wasn't expected to find a decent guy, while Sean had a lot on his plate. And they are just so different. The problems... where not overwhelming, and the problems are solved mostly by coincidence, not through characters' own efforts, which makes the book read rather.. .strangely.

To recap... Hollywood sweetheart Mia Troy needed some R&R at the nice and quiet Victorian Rose B&B before she goes off to start her new movie. She's traveling alone and incognito, trying to be be recognized, and she was surprised to find Sean O'Brien, co-owner of the B&B, recognized her, but gave her no further admiring glance. He simply saw her as another person, something she did not expect. Sean gave up on his dreams when his father walked out on the family, and stayed to run the family B&B to take care of his mom and younger sister. Now that little sister had married into a rich family, he had quietly gone ahead and got his degree, and planned expansion into the next door building, and was surprised to find his mother against the expansion. Sean also found himself accepting Mia's friendship... and reciprocating, as he was not immune to Mia's charms, but he was convinced Mia merely wanted a fling, nothing more. But as Sean escorted Mia to local events, their attraction to each other grew, even as Sean was contacted by his estranged father, and learned that something he thought was the truth... was not... Then he was told that whatever tied him down... Is no longer a concern. Sean must now decide, should he just retreat and sulk, or take a chance for the happily ever after?

To explain the problem, I'll have to spoil the ending.

SPOILER AHEAD

Generally, in a novel, you have the characters STRUGGLE to achieve a goal. In Romance, the characters had to struggle to overcome whatever's keeping the two main characters apart. So what keeps Mia and Sean apart? Primarily Sean's ties to the Victorian Rose, and his sense of obligation to his mother, whom he had believed was wrong (and so was he) many years ago when his father walked out on them. When the truth was revealed... his mother cheated first, THEN his father walked out. Sean's belief was completely shattered. Then his mother informed him that she's selling the entire B&B to their in-Laws who managed huge hotels and want to get into the B&B business. So Sean was no longer tied to the home he had. He is broken, but free to pursue Mia Troy in Hollywood. Sean did NOTHING to change his circumstances. Things just ""happened"" to him. That makes for a very UNsatisfying read.","When MMC didn't have to struggle to overcome his circumstance to pursue the FMC, the romance just doesn't flow despite sweetness",6,2/11/2017

 I loved Mia right from the start, especially because she wasn't a spoiled starlet. She was so open, honest, and really down to earth. She never wanted to call attention to herself, yet....she was so understanding and very accomadating to all those who asked for an occasional picture, or an atuograph.

Sean on the other hand was quiet and very reserved, but then it's very understandable after what he'd been threw growing up. After your dreams and your family suddenly fall apart at basically the same time, you tend to stop believing in HEA's. He's the kind of guy who sits back and accesses the whole situation at hand, before he opens himself up and starts to trust.

And I loved all the descriptive writing about the area, especially the places within, and surrounding Boston. If I ever get a chance to go there one day, I'll be sure to check out some of the hot spots the author talked about.",A very heart-warming story.,4,2/9/2017

Sean has worked hard to help his mother make the B&B a success.  His father had abruptly divorced his mother 18 years ago and had never contacted his two children again.  Sean had given up a scholarship to remain at home and help support the family.  I admired his character and loyalty to his family.  However, I found him to be straight-laced and rather cold.  I could not understand why Mia pursued a relationship with him.  I didn't feel any chemistry between the two of them.  Yes, they had sex but it just seemed a little ""off"" to me.  I also didn't care for Sean's mother.  It seemed to me that she took advantage of him over the years when she needed his support and then just suddenly cut him off at the knees when she didn't.  I didn't find the ending to be  satisfactory, either.  I wanted to know if Sean took the MIT job.  I may have missed it because by the end I was guilty of skimming to finish.

The hero felt like he was more of a mentor to her than someone who wanted a romance with her.  He said all the right things...that she was attractive, etc., but I did not feel it.  I love books where the heroine is shy and timid and nerdy and the hero is someone completely opposite from her, but Sophy's behavior just felt forced.  Out of no where her repeating how she was always tongue tied around men, she mentioned the guys she was previous with.  I wish I would have highlighted it to quote the way the heroine said it.  Weird.

 The verbiage and inner monologue did not work for me.  The hero used verbiage like ""milk teeth"". (Loc 427)

And, really, for a former second son who was a hell-raiser and troublemaker, he did pretty well reaching the point he needed to be at.

Pretty well, indeed.

So. Lily and Marcus. And Rose. Because I like her. Their romance is of the slow and sweet variety. Which I actually liked. I mean, usually I'm all for insta-lust and everything, but the slow build up to the inevitable clandestine grope worked for me. This time, at least. And Lily's bravery in telling Marcus what she wanted after that first grope made me cheer. Girl power in a corset, man!

I would be remiss if I didn't mention how much I adored how Marcus tried to do right by Rose. Big, strong men who are devoted to their families make me grin. Even if he didn't exactly start out right with her, he made up for it. I appreciate that.

She had a normal teenage life. Mean girls tormenting her and a cute guy she was crushing on. Life wasn't easy as it was but then things got even worse. She was to lead an army of werewolves to fight demons and she was so not ready for that....
This book intrigued me from the very beginning. I loved reading about Grazi and her life. All the supporting characters were well written as well.

Orphaned at a young age, Grazi has always been the ""lone wolf"" of her community. She has Nonna to care for her, and she lives among the family of her family. Yet she has never truly belonged with anyone, maybe not even fully with Nonna who took her in at her very worst. Her family-situations becomes increasingly more complex when her father's family shows up out of no where, changing her life forever. Could things get any worse?

Now it is up to Grazi to train to fight the forces of evil, as a creature sanctioned by God for the very purpose of serving Him and His creations. Grazi might have always been different, but the forces at work around her are far beyond her wildest imaginings. She can only hope that when the time comes, she will be strong enough to lead the battle against evil and restore goodness to the world.

I liked this little story. It was no novella, but it was not the full-blown novel that I was expecting either. It always amazes me when good authors can fit so much story into such a short number of pages. The plot advanced quite nicely and was paced at a manageable rate. Very well done.

The only issue I had were the spattering of grammatical errors throughout the book, but nothing too severe as to detract from my enjoyment and the story itself.

It's so nice to see a male sub who is not a feminized wimpy sort of individual but is rather strong and masculine.  He has the dominant personality to be successful in business but when it comes to Sam, his female love interest, his submissive sexuality takes over his thought processes.  Folks that don't have a dominant or submissive nature may not get all there is to this novel.  As a sub minded male, I totally relate to Gib.  He has his reasons for not giving in completely and submitting to Sam at first.  As the book progresses she slowly pulls him closer to the edge.  Her motivation is not one of ego or sadistic selfishness but rather it is her love for him that has her pushing his buttons.  Sam puts her emotions on the line as much or more than Gib.

Isabel is a New York artist whose idea of love is an uncomplicated romp in the hay with an older French gentleman or a former high school sweetheart who she had left without so much as a kiss goodbye. The protagonist, Isabel, is not a character that elicits a lot of empathy, though the plot does develop some side characters with enough sympathy to fill the void. Kimmie Dee seems to be the typical kid, and it's obvious she still loves her dad, though he's not exactly a rocket scientist. Former high school sweetheart isn't one either and he is unhappy...just plain unhappy, so he is easy...just...easy. The dialogue reflecting the intellect of the various characters takes on an interesting hue. The antagonist was perhaps obvious, though certainly not the one we wanted to be the villain. Her hapless aunt, Merriam, has done the best she could and though no love lost, leaves Isabel knowing her death wasn't a natural one.

It's a reasonably well-thought-out mystery that I found somewhat but not entirely predictable.

Its weakest point, I think, is that none of the characters come across as likeable or even sympathetic, except maybe for Isabel's aunt's nurse, and one small child. Since we don't spend much time with either of them, that doesn't help much.

I also did not care for the carefully anonymous chapters from the killer's point of view; I'm not even sure that they were necessary, and they did show the author explicitly withholding information. Mystery authors need to do that! but they should be more subtle about it, I think!

Most authors just write ""they fell in love instantly"", what made these two people fall in love and i want to see this in more stories.  Another thing that I did not like about this book is the fact that i was on the borderline of not liking the female heroine, which is horrible by the way.

3253,5,A2RU61YN9M0IDQ,B00IUL9ALG,"Another lovely story by Maureen Driscoll. Ms Driscoll combines historical romance with little spicy bedroom (or any other room) scenes. My only complaint with this book is that there wasn't a solution to the money problems for the Earl of Ridgeway. It almost didn't feel finished but it was still a good book. I had a hard time putting it down. The Earl, Colin, is faced with a great deal of debt thanks to his father and grandfather. He is an honorable man with a good heart and seems to take in ""strays"" so to speak even though he hasn't the means. His valet, Stempel, is a war vet with horrible burn scars on his face and shoulder and is treated badly by the general public because of his appearance. Colin has told him he is going home to the country and doesn't have the blunt to take him too. Stempel begs him to take him as Colin is the only person to treat him fairly and he has no where to go. He can't get employment due to his disfigurement, he doesn't know what he would do. Colin tells him he can't pay him but Stempel tells him he doesn't care. So off they go on the mail coach which they get thrown off from because some yahoo can't stand to look at him. Good grief! Anyway they go to the home of a person he went to school with hoping to get a little help to get home but is treated in a humiliating manner. The person is a viscount who has always had a mean streak and was a bully in school , so you can imagine the scenario. Additionally his staff treat Stempel just as badly except for one of the maids, Maude, who turns out to be a very nice person. Colin meets the governess in a comical situation and she turns out to be just as nice as Maude. The viscount tells Colin he has to perform the role of Juliet dressed in the governess' dress. Really?

3255,4,A2O2BT03OA88IR,B00IUL9ALG,"My Review:
First response: I wish we had half stars, I'd give this 3 1/2 stars. It was good with lots of interesting characters that will make interesting reading in the following books. Rose, especially. Check my blog for a full review soon.

This was a traditional historical romance except that it has explicit sex. So, if that's not your thing, skip this one. I found it a bit gratuitous actually.

Colin may be an Earl, but being penniless with two sisters to marry off, he needs an heiress. However, his relationship with Ava is forecast all over the first few pages. He's the type to take in every wounded bird he sees. His valet is so badly scarred from burns that people don't want to be around him. Ava is not being treated well as a governess and the future at her current position looks even grimmer. Colin to the rescue! He takes along the assistant cook as well, since she's a friend of Ava's and she's not put off by his valet's scars.

So he's returning from his trip to London to find an heiress to marry without the heiress. And with two extra mouths to feed. And he finds his family is now living in the Dower House and has rented out the family mansion. At least one person in his family has some common sense! That would be Rosemary, his sister.

Rose is one of those characters that will make interesting reading in other books. Her practicality may yet save their neighbor, the Marquess of Grayson. I'm sure Colin's half-brother, Nicholas, the Earl of Layton will have a story of his own as well. As will James Emerson, Colin's younger brother with the illegitimate daughter who is half Native American.

In spite of its shortcomings, I liked this book and will try some of the author's other offerings. This was a BookBub acquisition. My honest review is offered without any compensation. All opinions are fully my own.

3260,3,A2PZ93F1NJ716D,B00IUL9ALG,"Interesting and unusual story line, but rather thin. I liked the idea of an impoverished earl following his heart instead of going after a fat purse. Colin is likeable, but i find him too unimaginative when it comes to the state of his finances. The story dragged and i got bored and irritated with Colin's inability to find a single option for a possible solution to his predicament, yet he keeps telling himself that everything will work out. In fact, his sister Rose is much more capable. And if not for Ava's idea, he would not even have ventured with the writing. It didn't look like he would have managed on his own. For a while it seemed the only way he could earn some coins was by making a fool of himself before his stupid acquaintances. Ava is a strong and witty woman who also happens to be caring. It is thus understandable that Colin should fall for her, but i never felt a real romance or a strong attraction. Sure the author wrote about it, but it didn't reflect as it should. The only time i felt the vibes of attraction was during the road encounter of Rose and Nick, and that was but a few paragraphs. I might buy their story.

I also got confused at the start with all the names -- Colin, Conway, Clayton, Leyton... i had to go back and check again who's who. Too many characters really, but with a wide array of names available the author picked four with a C that rhymed too.

I appreciate the author's warning about the explicit contents. And yes, they were there. I didn't like them; if they were entirely left out they won't be missed but of course they counted for more words.

All in all, the book is okay but far from memorable.",I liked the idea of an impoverished earl following his heart ...,10,11/18/2016

The story is absolutely soul wrecking and I loved every second of it. I've read it before and I probably can read it a hundred more times and enjoy it just as much. And if you are familiar with this series I strongly recommend adding audio because the voice will melt your brains and panties:-)

The writing style is perfect in my opinion, easygoing, fun and also serious. There are no unnecessary description only what's essential to the story. The characters are well described and I feel like I know them.

Andrea and her stubbornly refusing to ask for help is so heartbreaking because I can picture her as a little girl depending on her self and feeling rejected. Cullen's way of helping her get over it is sneaky but perfect. The ending is great.

Her penance is taking care of a wounded vet in darkest Maine, a job she gets cuz her mummy and daddy know someone who knows someone who knows the vet's daddy.

Once in Maine, she discovers that ""Mr. Paul"" is a self-absorbed jackhole extraordinaire.

He does or says something mean, then goes ""sorrysorrysorry,"" then goes back to square one and escalates the nastiness. These episodes are interspersed with increasingly intense sexual advances, which Olivia apparently finds irresistible.

(So there's an investment to make, if you want a little more spice in your life.) We've only made a beginning in testing these out, but the results in all cases were good, although I think many Indians born would like these dishes to be several notches hotter.

We cook a lot of beans and so it's been particularly fun to put a new ethnic twist on an old po' folks' favorite. We also made several of the vegetable dishes which were successful and tasty, as well as a well-received Pork Vindaloo, that universal favorite of Indian restaurants everywhere.

I have loved both for decades, and although my wife's first introduction to Indian food (at a restaurant in her hometown) wasn't auspicious, we have since had spectacular food, and she is a convert. I've tried to learn solid techniques for some of our favorite dishes, but good Indian cookbooks are somewhat rare. Good Kindle cookbooks are just as rare, in my opinion. Most Kindle cookbooks make poor use of photography (though it is incredibly easy to insert a chart or picture in an electronic file!), are poorly organized, and rarely have consistent links to other recipes in the cookbook. I am a very experienced cook. I worked my way through college as a cook, sous chef, and head of kitchen at several restaurants, and I continue to work in the food industry, more than two decades later. If I buy a cookbook, I expect it to have a thorough description of the cooking techniques, excellent recipes, interesting design, and a series of great illustrations (maybe not every recipe, but at least every few recipes). Most Kindle cookbooks I've seen fall FAR short of every one of these expectations.

This cookbook was substantially better, on all counts. It starts with a solid explanation of the spices, cooking techniques, and general overview of Indian food and how it's served, before diving into a series of excellent recipes. I wish there were a few more pictures, but it averages somewhere around one for every three or four recipes, and the ones that are included are gorgeous. Plus, the text is heavily linked throughout the cookbook. I can't understand why other authors don't do this more. It's one of the biggest advantages of the e-book format!

We saw in the book about Radford how much he adored his little girl Rebecca, and we saw in Duke and Faith's romance how Adam was instantly enamored with 13-year-old Rebecca - and now after 10 years of waiting, they can finally be together. But oh my!  Such an awful accident happens!  Oh goodness, when she opens her eyes and sees him, it rips your heart out how much he loves her - in sickness and in health.  You ache for them, for what they had and lost, and with every page you want them to find one another again. Such poignant scenes in this book, but oh, it ends so wonderfully.  The twists and turns of the story, and the magical coincidences, kept me enthralled and I found myself thinking about the characters and the book as if they were real people during times I was away from my kindle, lol.  I read the first four Grayson brothers books a year ago and just now got this one, but it was well worth the wait.  Bravo for a job well done!",What a romance!,10,7/4/2016

There was far too much description about places, shipbuilding, sawmill operations and not enough focus on the romance.  I felt the adult romance failed to live up to the promise of young love.

Their reactions were too dramatic, too...""I'm taking my ball and going home!"".  Because of that, the dialogue also felt immature, coming from their over-reactions.

Chloe's mother and grandparents were caricatures of real people.  Harold felt real.  So did her family on Pearl Island.

3297,5,A3UH8APHKYPTVU,B00IZ1BY0G,"This is a beautiful memoir. It brings back a lot of memories from growing up. Although the experiences in the book are specific to the author, I think they are, to a certain extent, universal. Things about what it's like growing up and finding your place in your family, relationships with your parents, making friends and fitting in, finding first love, and striking out on your own. Dealing with loss.
In this memoir, the author grew up on a farm, the third of four children, growing up in the 1950's and early 1960's. She lost her mother to cancer when she was 14, and has painful memories of that time - how it changed her family and especially her dad.
While each person's experience is unique, many persons suffer the loss of a close person while still young. In my case, my father walked out on our family, when I was three, never to be seen again. I know the long term effects that has had on me.
The book is at times almost poetic in prose, a timeless kind of beauty in the way the words blend together. Between each chapter, there are color drawings of a different kind of flower, and a few lines about how that particular flower was special to her mother, and a special lesson she learned from her mother based on the meaning behind that flower.
This is a special book. It is loving, and at times filled with much personal pain. I feel enriched for having read it.",Life is a story.,4,4/21/2016
3298,5,AM1XDIUYI64JB,B00IZ1BY0G,"Profound thoughts are explained here in the most simple manner. That's all one can say about this book. It is difficult to write a more objective review, because the impact the author will have on you will make you see life and its problems in a wise and practical way. The book should NOT be read - it should be absorbed and reflected upon.

This book has helped me clarify my thinking, process my feelings, and make better decisions. If you are you ready to stop drifting and design a life you love, this read with help you on your journey. The author has put her heart in the pages of this book that will encourage and give hope to the reader. So many wonderful and courageous people share their experiences through books, and I thank this author for sharing hers.

The overall tone was simply imparting knowledge, personal experience and wisdom in a gentle and generous way. Her words will help to better equip you to interpret and handle life in a whole new way, which in turn will bring peace, love and joy into your life. If you are looking for inspiration and encouragement in the face of loss, this would come highly recommended from me.

The Strongest Bond: A Memoir, is a wonderful read that will leave you feeling like a better person for having read it. It's another impressive read from Susan Brougher and I'll certainly be looking forward to reading more from her in the future. A well deserved five stars from me.",A Powerful and Inspiring Read,3,4/13/2016

I've used lavender oil for years since my husband was in intensive care and the nurses dabbed it on his pillow with a cotton ball. He was anxious and the oil is very calming and allows one to rest. I also learned a dab of essential oil goes a long way --- so don't over do it. Very informative book. Recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about essential oils and their uses.

I can understand a little why this was ditched but I actually liked the fact that this version got rid of the ""Logan loves Sam"" issue early in the game.  Of course that would have changed the trajectory of the entire series, though.

I loved the Rex, hamster, and freezer thing, which I found hilarious. Sam was fairly stupid in this one but I guess I can't really blame her too much. This is a girl who was abandoned a lot. Much of it has to do with Analise, as always, but it was interesting to see how the other adults in her life seem to be pretty clueless too. Helen seems like the same bigoted witch and the Elite and Public girls all seem pretty much the same too. The Becky and Adam thing was unbelievable. Becky was really stupid and way too clueless during this book. Her demeanor was OTT with the bouncing and giggling and stuff. Shallow.

Cassidy had saved up enough to start an RV park for the little town of Evansville ready for the oil boom, and it's coming along fine, until Grady McKenna came back into town. Grady can't wait to get out of Evansville even if he had to join the military to do it, but after a tour in Afghanistan he's ready to come home, hostile family or not, even though he had no intention of dishonoring his family and Cassidy was the woman that caught his attention. Can the man who wanted to stay catch the woman who can't wait to leave it all behind? The tension between the two are palpable as Cassidy, due to spillover from her mom was avoided by men in town, which is just great for Grady, but Grady meets hostile reception from Cassidy (you're too good for me, of course) and the rest of family (who thinks Cassidy as a golddigger). Additional b--plots like mom getting into more trouble, the town's bluebonnet festival, and Grady's hosting a mother and her kid for his best friend surely complicates matters.  The side plots are handled deftly and the tension sizzles between the two characters. The little Texas town feel was portrayed expertly.

But of course, as is true of the majority of romance literature, there is a happy ending.
I loved the way Gio had difficulty believing he had done anything wrong whenever he upset Julia. He had a lot to overcome in that department, but in others he was superb. And he was very romantic, sometimes to the extreme, but I'm not complaining - it made good reading.
Julia is not a dumb bimbo by any means. She comes across as responsible, caring, level headed and very lovable and has a great sense of humour.

I grabbed this book for a fast and light read, but actually ended up enjoying it more than I expected.  Characters have more substance than in an average romance and I especially liked that there are no unnecessary fights or stupid misunderstandings involved in the plot.  The heroine is fun and independent and the Hero is typical Alpha male.  Good chemistry between them and a couple of explicit sex scenes.
It does end with some holes in the plot ( many secondary characters that will have their own books as the series continue ), but as there is an ending for Gio and Julia's story,  that is Ok for me.  I will continue reading the series.

3352,3,A29R9A85J2JGRU,B00J16SQFU,"Ok, I have now reached book 7 in the series and I want to warn new readers to the series from the get go. The mysteries are interesting. That said, the female characters are so one dimensional it begins to wear thin. The main character is a female who overloads on hormones at the drop of a dime. Clearly the author has never had a strong woman in his life. Detective Sexton (really?!) spends more time bemoaning her (boohoo) dead daddy issues than actually solving crime. I have lost count of the emotional breakdowns and crying to sleep moments in the series to date. As I said before so far I have found the good mystery overbalances the poor character development, however, I'm not sure that balance won't be tipping soon. I have read other series where the characters are stereotypes, like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. What makes her palatable is laughs, some times laugh out loud dialogue. These female characters demonstrate a humor more on par with say a 12 year old boy. I seriously doubt I can continue to read the series back to back for much longer. I will probably take a break and say reread Nora Robert's (as  J D Robb) In Death series for the 10th? time to cleanse my palate before picking up this series to finish even once. I seriously doubt I will reread this series, I just hope I can get thru these cardboard characters once.

The laughter came at the author's ability to give the characters' great dialogue and wonderfully imaginative phrases. For example...""...he disappeared faster than a necklace during a Lindsay Lohan shopping spree."" and that was only in the first few pages. The main character has a canine partner which, in my opinion, is always good and also a friend that is a bit off the wall but always trying to help.

The first few scenes set up the foundation for the rest of the story perfectly by throwing in little hints as to what the protagonists true nature really is  it was this set up within the first few chapters that originally caused me to become hooked on the plot, and the momentum stayed strong until the very end.

3357,2,A19CCHJ37SPNLJ,B00J1SGHWW,"I came as close as I've ever come to not finishing a book at the 7% mark, and I seldom set a book aside before finishing it.  There was no sign that this book was more polished than a first draft.  There were incomplete, meaningless sentences, missing words, extraneous words, continuity problems, and a lack of logical behavior on the part of most of the characters. The author kept flipping between different tenses.

This author joins scads of other writers in thinking that women are attracted to men by visual cues.  Either the men are body builder types or are seen naked or both.  This author goes for the latter approach.  She finds ridiculous ways to place the H in front of the h with little or nothing on. Then she builds lust upon lust. The H has just been having sex with some random woman and less than 5 minutes later is kissing the h.  In what world would a normal woman find that appealing, honorable, or sexy?  In what world would a 26 year old woman who has 3 broken engagements, the last one physically abusive, wouldn't find a self-described man-whore sexy especially when he shows no boundaries either?  In my world a man with a terrific personality is sexy, regardless of his body or wealth.  Likewise, she is presented as very plain looking with only hair, makeup, and expensive clothing to make her at all appealing, but magically she is a flawless incredible beauty to the H, even without makeup and fancy clothes.  Even allowing for differences in tastes, this is hard to buy into.

The book did finally come together, the typos and editing issues less frequent and the plot somewhat less predictable.  I managed to finish it an even enjoyed it a bit beyond the train-wreck aspect.  But the author has the H give the h complete clarity over fundamental lifelong struggles in a sentence or two and she returns the favor for him later. Their life stories are shared in just a few moments while the H leaves his bar business unattended. But at least the author tried to give them a backstory and life struggles.

All sex shared between the two is unprotected sex with no regard for the great number of partners they cumulatively had sex with no concern about STDs or family planning.  Irresponsibility and lust rule in this book.

I've read books written by an author who has learned English as an adult with more typos, and I've read books that have no character to the characters nor plot, but there are a lot of better books out there.

I really couldn't warm up to either of them.  Part of the problem might have been the way the story was written.  I don't like stories written in first person.  Some authors seem to think that writing first person and then switching back and forth as each character moans on and on about their 'poor, poor me' lives is entertaining.  To me it is not.  the plot was dull and not original.  A little humor might have brightened this dreary tale, but unfortunately, there was none.

3361,5,A3V5PF0VHX1ZGR,B00J2ZVDK0,"To Love a Wicked Scoundrel is Anabelle Bryant's first book in her Regency Rogues Series, and it was an amazing read. I loved it so much as soon as I finish this review I am off to read the next one!

This book tells the story of Isabelle Rossmore and Constantine Highborough, the Earl of Colehill, along with a great supporting cast of characters that really add to the story. This is the story-

Meredith, (Isabelle's Stepmother) a young widow of 30, has finally been able to take off her widow's weeds, and it has been a long waiting period. Meredith loves to follow the scandal pages and she has decided to move herself, her step daughter Isabelle, who is only 26, and never had a coming out season, and her daughter Lily of 6 years, along with their servants to  a beautiful home right across the street from Constantine Highborough, the Earl of Colehill's London home! Who is Constantine? He is London's most notorious scoundrel, rake, homewrecker call him what you will, but that is who he is! Meredith is enamored of this man, whom she has never seen but has already decided she wants to have an affair with, just for during the season, of course! It is the person to spend time with as his reputation is that of a man who spends time with widows, or married women, as he has no plans to ever wed! He is said to be quite the lover, and he has left a trail of broken hearts behind him.

Isabelle, a 26 year old virgin, who spends her days in her garden, and looking after her precious step sister who she adores, is too quiet, practical, and uninterested in having a love life, or a husband for that matter! One of the main reasons is because for the first 24 years of her life her father, The Earl told her she was ugly with her red hair, unusual coloring, figure and that she was always a disappointment to him.  He mentally abused her so bad that even her step mother could not stand it and could not understand why he told Isabelle that-she was a beauty!  Meredith was married off to him by her father and all Isabelle's father wanted was a second chance of having a son! Meredith yearns for a chance of having a good time for a change!

Once they get to London, Meredith hauls Isabelle and little Lily off to the dressmakers where they spend a ton of money on brand new wardrobes for all 3 of them and everything that entailed, shoes, bags, hair accessories, jewelry, hair ribbons, you get the picture. Isabelle is horrified at how much money her stepmother spends; she can afford it she is wealthy but Isabelle is just too practical to enjoy it! After trying on the first beautiful gown however she is secretly pleased!

They also get invited to a gathering the second day they are there thanks to Lady Newby an old dowager of the ton, so they move fast! Meredith, reminding Isabelle they are off to the start of their adventure, ride over to the gathering. Meredith is in her element, there are so many people there and all Isabelle can think of is how many people there are and the fire hazard!

In the meantime Constantine, who had been hanging out with his friends, finally goes out into the gathering and when he sees  Isabelle, he is struck by her beauty! He sends a footman to secure the last dance of the night with Isabelle but the footman approaches Meredith instead who is ecstatic!

Isabelle, after hearing Meredith's tale of how she got to dance the last dance with Constantine, wanders off to the library to get away from the noise, and that is when  Constantine finally sees her! He asks her ""What are you doing here? Have I interrupted a theft in Lord Rochester's study? Or are you here awaiting a prearranged lover's tryst?"" Isabelle is stunned by him but quickly replies, ""Nothing as interesting or exciting as you suggest, I assure you.""  He then tells her he had meant to waltz with her that evening, and she mentioned to him he had to sign a card for a dance or was he used to getting everything he wanted and he said ""always."" He is so charmed by her! He also grabs her card without her realising it!

This starts off their relationship, and the next thing she knows he shows up everywhere she is like across the street at the park she takes Lily to, and he meets Lily and she loves him! It is impossible because she knows her stepmother wants him, and she has admitted to herself she is charmed by him too, the first man she is ever enamored of! So she is excited but miserable.

Read this book and see what happens, but I assure you this book is awesome. There is excitement, scandal, theft, laughter and tears, there is sexual angst and a few matters of the heart! Also it is interesting when you will read and find out that Constantine is not what everyone says he is! He is amazed when Isabelle turns out to be so discerning and seeing him for who he really is. There is a kidnapping, and there is love. There is a frightening scene involving Lily that has everyone scared out of their wits and it is the turning point in the novel, read and find out what I mean by that!

I gave this book 5***** brilliant stars for how brilliantly this book is written and I hope you love it as much as I have!

It's been on my kindle for quite a while, like many of the books I will be reading over this writing break I'm taking. I'm glad to get back to my favorite genre, and this book was a great way to return.
Set in the building civil war, Alexandra doesn't sympathize with her Alabama wealthy family roots. Instead, she loves the slave woman who raised her more than her own mother, and secretly smuggles slaves out of the state. While to the outside world, she's the well-bred daughter of a highly respected family, and her hand is being sought after by an even wealthier young man.
But Alexandra knows she can't live in a loveless marriage, despite how much her parents push the young man on her, turning a blind eyes to his less than savory characteristics. Instead, she falls in love with a Native American man, William, who is everything her intended lacks, but also everything she's not allowed to have.
Since I have my own Native American man who I love and married, I naturally felt connected with Alexandra's love and attraction to William. It saddened me to watch them struggle against not only her world, but his as well to be together. They were a couple who matched up brilliantly, Although, their love didn't build up how I would have liked, rather they kind of jumped from avoiding one another to kissing in the blink of an eye. I wish there had been a little more sneaking around and love letters to really build up the connection.
But the story does do a wonderful job of expressing the horrors of slavery and prejudice in the Southern United States at that time. It's a time I'm truly glad I don't live in, and Alexandra did well to overcome the struggles she faced and continued to stand by her beliefs and not break and conform, which ultimately saved many lives.

I did appreciate that the author touched on the fact that you will be missing some nutrients with this diet and advocates supplements, however I felt this was an important bit of information to avoid deficiencies and it was glossed over quickly in one paragraph at the end of one of the chapters. There is a lot of detail about why fats are favored in this diet and carbs are cut down on. I don't know enough about dietary science to speak on the factualness of this, however the author does include quite a bit of this information so it's worth the read if you're looking for this information. There are recipes included in this book and they all look good, however the formatting of them isn't very good.

Overall it's an okay book on the keto diet. It gives a lot of information you can find elsewhere, however if you're looking to have it in your book collection for quick reference, then it may be worth the buy for you.

My grandmother who was a farmer would make claims that the foods we eat today are probably a main factor to obesity as well as many health issues that people including myself are facing.  We are trusting companies to provide meals that are already processed with artificial additives and such and although some are delicious you start to realize how unhealthy they are when you begin to read the label.

For those reading my reviews, you probably remember I am in my mid-40s and eating better if part of my required way of life.  I don't always stick to my plan but at least try to for my own sake.  I picked up a copy of the Ketogenic Diet after reading from Author Samantha Michaels, that it has help children with epilepsy and how it may help people suffering from seizures and neurological disease.  Although that claim is yet to be proven.  With that said I figured it didn't hurt to acquire more insight to other perspectives and eating habits that I may as well entertain and see if it would benefit me and my family.

The ketogenic diet seems similar to many others but focuses on the balances of protein intake.  The author appears to have factual references regarding this plan and goes into explanation how to balance it all.
I enjoyed Chapter 4 more to show which foods were restricted.  Some diet plans often talk about theory but fail to provide an actual list on prevention leaving readers lost.

Chapter 5 is really interesting as it references the food groups.  Theres been so much talk about this pyramid.  At first, there were claims that people need to make sure they eat from each group.  Harvard(.)edu wrote a paper how the pyramid published in 1992 was identified in 2005 to be incorrect as the portions from each were incorrect.  At this time, looking at this pyramid I will wonder if anyone has really gotten it right.
In my beliefs, staying away from fat, sweets, carbohydrates or at least minimize intake and an active lifestyle where people do at least 3-5 hours of some moderate exercise should help everyone.  Strongly, a home cooked meal is definitely healthier than fast food which many Americans fall upon in their busy life.

Samatha Michaels did a good job in outlining the theory, allowable and restricted foods as well as provided the reader many recipes to try.  After reading this ebook I found chapter 7 the most valuable where I could actually try some of the recipes off hand.  Some weren't too bad and would recommend this reading material to anyone doing their best to try to have a healthier lifestyle.

Giving this book a 4 star because with all recipes I am willing to try requires some visual appealing photographs to appeal to the appetite.

*** mild spoilers ***

POD is an artificial intelligence (AI), who rebuilt Zirkos and 'Ship' from their imprinted 'patterns' following their physical destruction bu the Nubl, a race of angry bird aliens, made of crystal (if I get the vague descriptions correct from the story). This happened millions of years prior to the present day.

POD, with the patterns, lie in wait, having been encased in primordial glop until a severe storm in Britain washed it from a cliff onto the beach where it was exposed to sunlight.

POD reconstituted Zirkos and ship from materials found here and there around the solar system. The process needed a rare element which, by coincidence was in the head of a Iraqi war veteran named Zeke. After removing the rare metal from Zeke's head, the patterns are complete.

Zirkos, Ship and Zeke form an alliance with most of the nations of Earth by giving them alien tachnology, knowing that this would be necessary because of the pending invasion or the angry bird Nubl.

POD develops sentience and helps Zeke complete plans to resist the invasion while Zirkos, with Ship take off to parts unknown to 'find himself', leaving Zack and Earth to fend for themselves.

The Nubl invade but find the Earthlings more of a challenge than they were expecting, although the Earth took terrible casualties and damage.

This, roughly, is the substance of the first two books.

I found the story interesting, but not overwhelmingly so. This is not a story to lose sleep over, nor one that you can't wait to pick up again. In my opinion, it's just so-so.

The editing is fair, the science is rather nebulous and mostly made-up. When describing the actions of the Nubl, the author repeatedly indicate that they are to be attacking Earth, the fifth planet. Now depending whether you are counting from Neptune toward the Sun, or counting from the Sun outward, the fifth planet is either Jupiter or Mars. The Earth is the third planet outward from the Sun. ANY science fiction author should KNOW this! No wonder their mail is mis-delivered so often! Really!

Both books end, almost literally, in the middle of a paragraph. It's very jarring. No teaser for the next book at all.

The author also seems to have an aversion to using apostrophes to indicate the possessive. Maybe this is a Brit thing. It causes many a sentence to be reread to determine the intended meaning. Very frustrating, to say the least. As I stated earlier, the editing is only so-so. Most high school English students could do better.

In the past, I have been criticized by other reviewers for being too nit-picky concerning spelling, punctuation and grammer. I beg to differ. If an author writes, then puts his work out for public review, his work is a mirror of his/her character and intellect. When the story is rife with errors, it tells me that the author doesn't care enough about the quality of his work. If this is the case, quit writing until you are able to do so correctly. I accept that an occasional will squeak through at times, but when it's the same error repeatedly throughout the book, the author is at fault, not the reader. (Wow, my HS English teacher is probably spinning in her grave, seing me write THIS! Iwas never a good English student... but I've had sixty-eight years to learn.)

I won't be buying book three in this series. The interest just isn't there. Had the author done a better job of building suspense, perhaps he'd have another sale tallied up. Many parts of these books just read as if they were simple outlines of the story, rather than the story itself. (Zeke went here, POD did this, the Nubl do that).

Another thing, throughout the first book and half of the second, POD mostly identifies as being a male character. It turns out that POD is female. The reader doesn't discover this until POD is given a better pair of speakers. Who knew it would be that easy to change genders? This could be the breakthrough that transgenders have been waiting for! Huzzah!

3380,4,A2S5EPJ451WL3I,B00J7XE8KY,"An Unwilling Husband is a historical ""western"" romance that felt very angst-y at times, between two very damaged people who had forgotten how to love, against the world who are out to get them somehow.

Margaret ""Maggie"" Flemming used to live in a small town in Texas, until her mother, one day, dragged her off onto a train and headed back East. Now her mother's gone, she's grown, trained in the society ways that she felt she never belonged. Her aunt Margaret had nothing but cruel words to her for months. Maggie finally had enough and left for her hometown, to her father whom she hadn't seen for a decade, and to Garret Shaw, the boy she thought she'd spend eternity with. But Garret was a changed man. Years of abuse by his father had taken a toll, and the loan Garret had taken out from the Jennings family is coming due, and Jennings will not negotiate. The easygoing boy is now a hardened rough young man, who had no affection to give, esp. not a girl who was used to high society. Only one day after Maggie's arrival, Maggie's father passed away in a field accident. Her father forced Garret to make a deathbed promise: marry Maggie, even though Garret was supposed to be marrying Anna Jenning, and the dowry would cover the loan. Garret did as promised: married Maggie that same day, but refused to consummate the marriage. As Maggie learned ranch life from the foreman and the two Native Americans on the ranch, the Jennings started making overt threats... About how Anna's honor was besmirched, how Maggie should just go away or perhaps... ""went away"", and how eventually the farm will be theirs. Garret cannot allow himself to love Maggie, as he knew she'd head back East when she got tired of the rough life, but he will protect her with his life if need be...

Frankly, the push-pull between the two and the world were great. but the ending was too... ""neat""? It's as if EVERYTHING was being resolved, at a finger-snap. It's not just HEA, but ""Everything is <bleep>ing Fantastic Ever After"".

Ms. Shanley is a new author to me, and other than a few modern terms and phrases, I found her voice and style a good fit for the western romance genre. Set in the wilds of Texas, Maggie has left her Boston home and evil aunt to live with a man she considers her father. She's also hoping to meet up again with childhood friend and the love of her life Garrett. When she does, she discovers Garrett is nothing like the caring teenage boy she remembers. Presently, he doesn't like her, even resents her, and marries her against his will after her father dies in a tragic accident. But beneath the temperamental man lurks a a heart worth knowing; a kind soul with a gentle hand. And Maggie is going to prove to him she's not as weak as he seems to think, even if it kills her.

3386,5,A2CFRTLKV4YKJW,B00J8UD1OK,"I've read many of C. G. Cooper's books, starting with the Corps Justice.  Many books in to the series, I realized there was another series about a character that joined the team a few books in.  His name is Daniel Briggs.  This series is about Daniel before he knew about Cal Stokes and his group.  Daniel is a highly decorated former marine who served in the Middle East, and is trying to drown his PTSD in alcohol.  He has a destination in Florida, traveling by bus, but drinking along the way.  His last memory is of the bus stopping for a rest stop, and going into a bar, and he wakes up with a pounding hangover in someone's barn.  Hearing voices, he realizes someone is after him.  Instead of hiding, he confronts them and the insuing fight tangles him with a corrupt but powerful family in a small town.  Befriended by the farmer who owns the barn, he finds things get complicated really fast, and he is in for a fight for his life and the people around him.
This book is even more exciting and fast paced than the other books Mr. Cooper has written, and I'm looking forward to the next 3 books in the Daniel Briggs series.

Dault, the friend, is perfectly fine. A man had to have written this because there is no emotional depth to any of the characters and the sex appears to be the main focus of the author. Etty has been sexually abused terribly but has no problem jumping into sex with a man she hardly knows (Dault). Jo (yes another woman) loves Linc but Linc thinks he isn't able to love anyone. He supposedly misses her terribly. So much so that he can't stop thinking about her. Even though he has sex with another woman not long after Jo leaves.

When Linc and Daulton meet Etty, Lincoln recognizes the broken souls they both are and a kinship develops.

3406,5,A1EBV706Z2AM38,B00JA1XLDS,"This is an excellent, third novel, by Charles Dickens.  Mr. Dickens writes very lengthy novels by modern standards.  They tend to explore social injustice and are laced with ironic humor.  There is also occasional great emotion and pathos.  Mister Dickens has the ability to make me, as a reader, identify with characters, to like some and also not like others.

This particular story is about a young man, the title character, and his family, following the death of his father.  Nicholas Nickleby is a fine and honorable young man, who is a true gentleman and also possesses both moral and physical strength.  He only displays the latter when necessary and appropriate,  otherwise he appears to be a meek, kind,  gentle spirit.  After his father dies he undertakes to take care of the rest of his family.  The story is about all of the characters,, the good and the miscreant, and all of the adventures and misadventures that he encounters.

As I understand it, this novel was published in a serialized format over many months.  My Kindle version has, I believe, 65 chapters, some of which are quite lengthy.  I read the book and listened to an audiobook narration simultaneously.  The audiobook was narrated by Simon Vance.  His work was excellent and added much enjoyment.  I read about a chapter a day and it took about two months.  Speaking for myself it was well worth it.  At the same time, I am quite sure that its length will not suit the tastes of some readers.

I have read numerous works by Mr. Dickens and am now trying to read all of his worksn order.  The setting is contemporary London of the author's day.  This novel fits the pattern of wry humor and observations about social injustice in contemporary British society.  Mr. Dickens combines a host of skills.  He writes beautifully of natural scenery.  He also is able, at times, to evoke great emotion.  There is a scene in this novel wherein a fine young man dies.  It is extremely well written and poignant.  While painful, it was beautifully written and may have been my favorite part of the novel.

There is also a chapter wherein the characters stop at a public house for a night and the various guests spin tales.  The chapter almost seems to be a non sequiiter.  What it reminded me of, stylistically, is a Victorian era version of ""The Canterbury Tales"".  I do not know for sure if that was the point or not.

There is also a part of the story wherein a character conceals himself in a room whilst a malevolent conspiracy is being conceived of.  This was a device that Shakespeare employed at times.  An example of this that comes to mind is Polonius in ""Hamlet"".  Again, I do not know if Mr. Dickens was paying tribute to Shakespeare or not at that point.

In summary, this is a very fine novel that is of great length.  When I speak to modern readers it is very clear to me that some do not wish to read something of this length.  In that regard this novel will not fit all modern tastes.  Speaking for myself, I enjoyed it very much and Charles Dickens has become one of my favorite authors.

The main message of this book is that you need to be able to sustain your diet, and use it more like a permanent eating style. The author aims to turn your body into a fat burning machine by using the foods and techniques used in Live It Not Diet. You are starving the fat and feeding the muscle. There is a prerequisite book, that is needed to read before this book, which is called Eat Meat and Stop Jogging, so I would go and read that one first. It will set you up to be able to best use the advice and protocol in this book. There is a section which explains all of the diseases and conditions that are contributed to by being obese and out of shape and good health, which is a great motivation booster. Another way that this book focuses on sustainability is by doing away with calorie counting, weigh ins on the scale, the need for most exercise, and omitting meat, coffee, and saturated fats. I can see these ideas being really appealing to a lot of people. The eating style is based on a low carb/high protein and fat diet, and limits the consumption of fruit and sugars.

3408,5,A301OH10S9UCV8,B00JBP264S,"I've picked up a few of Mike Sheridan's books and have found each of them helpful in their own way toward helping me lose weight. Supposedly 90% of everyone who loses weight gains it back within 5 years - but that's because they don't alter their lifestyle - permanently.

With Live it Not Die-[I]t, I'm learning how to ensure that I eat well - and properly. As Sheridan says in this book, it's ""fat loss"" not weight loss that is key. I want to be fit and healthy, and *enjoy* life, and Sheridan's books are certainly helping me achieve that goal.

Sheridan does say that by eating the foods he specifies, you can decrease body fat without exercising - that's the only thing in this book I disagree with him on. Exercising - well, participating in a sport such as biking - is fun and relieves stress!  Combined with a low carb diet that removes craving to other foods filled with sugar -  it works great!

Each of Sheridan's 14 ""principles"" towards eating right are backed up with studies that show that they work, and even why they work. You've heard that cholesterol is bad for you? Saturated fats? Sheridan shows why this isn't true. In fact as with his other books, there's a lot of ""food warnings"" out there that are totally bogus.

Among the very few of books that say eat well rather than dieting, this book impressed me in great deal. I really accept the concept of Mike Sheridan which he has expressed in this book. The language he has used is very simple and every one can easily understand this.

Today many people focus on diet to shape up their body and in turn they loose their weight leaving them unhealthy and loose their immune. Mike's concept provides a great solution for this and a low carbohydrate strategy is introduced. This book will show the importance of this strategy and how to follow it under the guidelines given. Burning the excessive fat is a highly recommended procedure and really useful for every one. I am looking forward to follow the guidelines under milk and dairy products as well.

This one was free and I actually like the author's lighthearted style - she writes Regency Romps that are intended to entertain and not be taken too seriously. I would guess that Claudy Conn is very well versed in Georgette Heyer's writings, and she incorporates aspects of Heyer's books from plotlines to a plethora of ""cant"" phrases. These mostly add to the flavor of the book, but are occassionally slightly off (ie: ""dance attendance with me"" should be ""dance attendance on me"").

*small spoiler*
As is typical in all of the dozen books I've read by Conn, the ""hero"" is dishonorable and the ""heroine"" has easy virtue as she is eager for him to take her innocence. It seems like many popular authors who want to include explicit scenes will have the couple engage in everything but intercourse until intentions are declared, but Conn's characters skip these preliminaries and the heroine's lost virtue becomes a typical plot device. Again.
* end spoiler *

The two-fold plot in this book is actually very good. Freddy is a 19-year old who had fallen in love with Serena and his uncle comes to extricate him and send him back to Oxford to finish school. Serena is very willing to send Freddy on his way. In the meantime, they witness a murder and become involved in discovering a traitor and thief in their midst. This part of the book kept my attention. Though several times I had to remind myself it's just a story - so be prepared to suspend your disbelief.

I listened to the audiobook and the narration is good. Good pacing and differentiation of voices and accents. Expression (acting ability) of the narrator is fine, but not outstanding,",3.5 Stars - typical for this author,6,4/6/2016

3417,4,A3NU5MG1VOINFB,B00JCS2GZ8,"I first picked up this book because of the cover. I mean it screamed READ ME. And also, the blurb pulled me in too. After all, I am a huge fan of Pretty Little Liars and Scream Queens. So, did this book accomplish what I had hoped? Overall, yes it did. I found it to be not only enjoyable but creepy and fun as well. However, I wish the book STAYED creepy. I wasn't really a fan of the ending or what was really killing off these girls. I cant go into details because if I do I will spoil it, but for some reason this just didn't do it for me. Other than that, the book is great.

The book is about a bunch of high school students who ultimately end up on the hottie list. Each year 10 girls are chosen and this forms an elite sisterhood between the girls. Unfortunately for the girls who made the list this year, something is killing them. Each and every death is made to appear as an accident. Is it, or isn't it? Thats the fun in reading it.

The characters in this book are pretty likeable. While it took me a little time to warm up to them, eventually I did. I liked Kenzie and her backstory especially where it concerns her family and her brother. The whole situation made me emotional and I could essentially feel the emotions her character was emitting. I also liked the secondary characters as they reminded me of my high school days. You have the popular kids, the nerds, the jocks, the cheerleaders etc. So overall, the characters were written well and fit into the high school clich.

The plot is interesting and pretty unique as I have never read a book like this before. This is what made reading it so exciting for me. Again, while I wasn't a fan of the ending the book still held its ground and was interesting.

Overall this is a very enjoyable 4 star read. If you like young adult mysteries with some serious creep factor than this is certainly one to consider. While I am not a huge fan of the price ($10.99 on kindle) its a good book worth getting your hands on",:: 4 Pretty Little Stars ::,6,2/25/2016
3418,3,A362OTFHCKBAQR,B00JCULR7O,"This book has potential. I loved the first third. It was refreshing to see a story about a unique individual with special powers that wasn't constantly whining about wanting to be like everyone else. I liked Linc right away and was drawn into the book. But then the second third of the book got way too predictable and almost ridiculous with repeating storylines. And by this point in the book I was irritated by all the crying. One or more characters are crying in almost every scene or multiple times in each scene. It's way overdone throughout the entire book. I had to stop reading. But I came back and skimmed through the bad parts and found the last third of the book readable and interesting again. So to sum up, the book is good in some spots, great in some spots, and bad in some spots. Overall I'd say it's worth reading and I plan to give the next book in the series a try.

After a little investigation (and help from fellow book bloggers), I now understand that Little Women actually has two different parts, the second part written one year after the original story and also published separately under the name Good Wives. The kindle version I have does include both parts, but after long deliberation I have decided not to continue with it. Why? Even though I really wanted to enjoy this classic, I had a hard time reading it and it took me ages just to finish the first part. Im not saying Little Women is a bad read, just that it either wasn't the right time or simply just not for me. And since I have read quite a few negative reviews about Good Wives in the first place, Im just not up for another struggle. I cant deny its a very well written story and I can see why so many people actually love it. I might actually have enjoyed Little Women a lot better if I would have read it 15-20 years ago But right now the story unfortunately didn't appeal to me. I was surprised I found myself unable to truly connect to the characters and it took me weeks and finally reading one chapter at the time just to make it to the end of Part One.

3426,3,A16FWXT6WQH9X9,B00JDY7UO8,"Little Women itself needs no reviews; this review only discusses the annotated version edited by Daniel Shealy.

Shealy does a good job of discussing Alcott's life and the circumstances in which Little Women was written; where his annotation falls short is in its explication of the book itself. He keeps explaining things that are obvious from the context and missing things that are unclear to a modern reader. Some examples from early in the book:

- Army shoes: what are they and why would you give them to your mother? Shealy doesn't tell us.
- In the play the March girls act on Christmas Day, there's a discussion of their props that mentions butter boats transformed into antique lamps. He explains that a butter boat is a dish made to hold butter (duh!) by not why it resembles a lamp or that the lamp in question is probably an oil lamp (I've always assumed it was one like Aladdin's lamp), something a modern young reader might not realize.
- Similarly, Jo has a slashed doublet that the March girls use as a costume; Shealy explains that a doublet was a tight-fitting coat worn by men, but not that ""slashed"" means that there are cuts in the outer fabric to show contrasting inner fabric for ornamentation, not that it's torn up.

I first read LW at age 8 or 9; even then I could figure a lot out from context. I'd like to see an annotated version that explains the things you *can't* guess at.","Explains the Alcott's life and how she wrote the book well, not so much the book itself",2,1/24/2016

At this point, Ysane is still not recovered from her near death experience.  The pace is so incredibly slow and there has been almost no interaction between Fallon and Ysane.

There have been a couple incidents where he picked her up and carried her.  Once when she was about to be killed after her rescue and twice just after she bathed and was naked.  Not a SINGLE word of romance was written during either of these incidents.  Not even the fact that she was naked was written.  It was like he did not notice her AT ALL, as if  they were robots with zero thoughts or emotions.  We only know about the characters from what they do, almost nothing of their thoughts.

He talks to his soldiers, walks up steps, walks around the castle and it describes that in detail.  Blah blah blah.  The book describes in great, exhausting detail the castles contents and layout.

She has a one-night stand with a guy, which is completely out of character for her.  The factual setup was good, but it started to go downhill pretty quickly.

Plot: There was a big twist in Book 2 that you new was coming even if you didn't know what it was.  Then after the twist it just got ridiculous.

Characters: In the beginning you think that the female protagonist is a fairly savvy businesswoman, even though she's at the beginning of her career, but by the end of book 2, she's acting as if it were the middle ages.  I understand crazy family dynamics and the old habits that one can fall back into, but this was over the top.  Jenna's BFF who initally was portrayed as a good friend, though a bit jealous of Jenna's advancement at her own family's firm, but by the end of book 2, she's acting like a 15 y/o without any emotional IQ whatsoever.  As for the guys, I just have no words.

Romance: seemed legit in the beginning, but then the declarations of love are too soon and unsupported by the context.

Technical aspects: I don't recal being distracted by glaring grammatical or editing errors, but that could be because I was so distracted by the plot crashing and burning.

Overall: i'm sorry I wasted my time.  i think I got this as a freebie in the hopes of an honest review, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.

The premise was crushed under the weight of poor writing, lack of transition, disjointed scenes, one dimensional characters and a boring plot. The more I read the more disgusting it got, and I like perverted, dark and twisted reads. I think what really got me is it felt like I was reading a teenage misogynists jerk fodder. It is one thing to have females in the book that are slaves, its another to treat them all with no characterisation and just slap names on them. It is not appealing, and it's overdone.

And to top it all of, the book is funny. Clearly this will not be everyones cup of joe but if you get a kick out of the idea of an alien race of dildos trying to achieve world domination by continuously copulating with earthlings then this is the read for you. Of course there is a secret facility in the desert and a secret organization that deals with alien threats and it all sounds a little familiar but it is so very well done.
If I have a gripe, it is that there is not enough detail in the story. Give me more, draw me further in with details and more fleshed out characters because I just loved what you did give me.
The author calls this smutpunk rather then erotica and I think that is appt. There are lots of alien dildos and numerous sexual encounters but it is the irreverent humor and the postmodern use of and repurposing of familiar themes and storylines that stays with you. This is the kind of book I can imagine being turned into a movie and becoming a cult classic. I want to call it Gonzo Literature and own a hardcover with a 1950s B-movie style cover.

MJ has a style of writing that isn't matched by any other author I know. It is a one-of-a-kind, never disappointing, HAVE TO READ it style that is always hot and fun to read.

You like sci-fi? He's got it in this one.
You want a look into that cliche of that certain anatomy men think with? He's got that covered...
You want hotness with fun? Yup...here too.

One of the things I like the most about MJ's books is his ability to always entertain and surprise me. Just when you think one thing will happen...BAM! Something else comes along. Such as the case in this short sci-fi themed, futuristic story featuring aliens and, um...other things.

This book is a fun, light read that takes you beyond the realm of reality and into a world filled with secret labs, wrestling women, and...toys!

As soon as I bought it,  I started reading and I was hooked from beginning to end.
It wasn't what I expected, didn't think it  was going to be about Alians, and once everything was explained in the ending it made sense and I kind of thought Alians are so much better than demons.
I liked the main character Zara, she's a fighter. And Jett is just so cool.
It was really fun reading this book,  with its romance, humour and bits of action , it made an interesting read. Especially the Alians. That is what hooked me to this series..
I will definitely be reading this series.

3475,5,AEMZRE6QYVQBS,B00JJPZUZM,"Andrew Davis has written a splendid little manual to large-scale memorization of Scripture that is not for the faint of heart but will develop in the adventurous practitioner a strong heart.

Davis attends to both the *why* and the *how* of memorizing entire chapters and books of the Bible. He distinguishes between meditation and memorization, but finds it difficult to accomplish the former without investing in the latter. I think hes right on this point, particularly as he notes the author's logical flow that is perceptible and eventually absorb-able when the object of ones memorization is a the wide Scriptural landscape rather than a short stopping-point here or there.

Davis method (the term seems preferable to technique) provides tracks for what will inevitably represent a long and even stubborn obedience in the same direction. He minces no words about the challenge of large-scale Scripture memorization, but encourages the readers that accomplishing this feat is more a matter of blood, sweat, and tears than of natural mental endowment.

I derive the title of this very brief review from one of Davis methodological steps. He calls it weeding the garden, which is the step he endorses that will allow the memorizer to return to what he or she has committed to memory and weed out the small errors (weeds) that will creep in.

This book (99 in Amazon Kindle format as I write this review) meets a bona fide need, is clearly a labor of love, and will without doubt move would-be memorizers past the various early-stage obstacles in this journey and on to the place where many words of the Word have been securely placed in the storehouse of the heart.",planting the garden,3,12/21/2016
3476,5,A9ANCWSHSCDJN,B00JJUZ1W4,"Tessa Dare is one of my favorite authors!  Her writing is equivalent to my all time favorite, Julia Quinn.

This books is another great romance from Ms. Dare!  Clio is such a wonderful heroine.  I loved her tenacity and determination.  Tired of waiting around for a fiance who clearly doesn't want to be with her, she is tired of waiting around for life to start and takes control of her own future!  She knows what she wants and she GOES for it!

Rafe, in love with his older brother's fiance, is determined to make Clio wait for his brother.  He feels it's his duty.  But isn't forbidden love one of the best kinds of stories?!  Rafe is different than any other regency romance hero that I've ever read before because he's a fighter by profession.  Usually the heros are some kind of title holding man with lots of money and power.  Rafe is a second son, no title, and fights for a living.  While Ms. Dare never says that Rafe has ADHD in the story (for obvious reasons, they didn't have labels or even recognized disorders like that), I believe that's what he has.  It makes for an interesting backstory for Rafe!  Clio is his perfect match and it was so fun reading about how they found each other.

This is the second book in the Castles Ever After series but isn't connected to the previous novel in any way except that Clio inherits a castle from the same Earl that the previous heroine inherited her castle from.  The next book in the series (When A Scot Ties The Knot) is another ""stand alone"" but the fourth book (Do You Want To Start A Scandal) is about Piers, Rafe's brother who was engaged to Clio for most of this book.  I would suggest reading Scandal right after Marquess and then go back and read Scot Ties the Knot.

This book is sexually explicit.  Tessa Dare writes some pretty descriptive and raunchy sex scenes.  Much more descriptive than most other regencies I've read.  Be aware if that's not quite up your alley.",I'd Say Yes!,3,5/10/2017

3478,3,A3IQ0P3M39IY8U,B00JLHHYWA,"I liked this book, but.... I didn't love it like I thought I would. What I liked the most about it though, was the fact that this is a nice, easy to read, clean romance novel. I just didn't feel the strong attraction between Dan & Traci, though. They were both very likable on their own, but together they just didn't seem to meld. Maybe it was because they seemed to be so different in personalities, and the fact that they lived two completely different life styles.

Traci was more of a down to earth country girl who was more comfortable hanging out with a few of her friends at the local diner, and was otherwise more of a homebody, rather than the partying type. She didn't need much to make her happy, she was totally okay with just enough to make life a bit easier. She was so involved with the church and it's festivities, it's what made her happy......the simple lifestyle.

 Dan on the other hand; went out to all of these expensive type hang-outs with his rich friends, and usually with different  shallow type women on his arm at each venue. They talked money constantly, like that was what made them the happiest. Making money, how to make more of it, and how best to spend it.

Then there's the fact that she loved everything that had to do with Christmas, while Dan with good reason I suppose...despised everything about the holidays. Can't much more different than that. And why he didn't figure out that Suzanne was playing him right before Traci's eyes, is beyond me. She totally monopolized his time the whole weekend, even rubbed the fact in her face at the party, yet.....he never cuaght on to what she was doing??? Come on....was he completely blind, or just too stupid to see it? And I am another one that thought I the author spent a little too much time talking about wine. What was up with that?

I'm not exactly sure where this story took a wrong turn, but I just didn't feel its heart, and I found it hard to truly connect to the characters because of all of those differences that I've mentioned above..","This is a good clean romance story....but it could have been a really great one, with a few minor tweaks.",2,11/5/2016

3485,5,AQBTNZ9ZD08PD,B00JMHT0K8,"For his first book, it is well written and informative on world history concerning Jerusalem. The main character struck me as a boring, self-centered academic, but as the story went on, he developed into a free thinker. He was always able to find the answers he needed, which sometimes seemed too quickly. But the quick finds kept the story moving quickly. His relationship with his wife stressed more on money and their fights, but she does contribute to the mystery. Still, he is a self-centered, devious nerd. (If that's not PC, try normal-challenged.)

Being decades ago, since I read about the history of the Jews, Muslims and Turks, and the other historical periods mentioned, I remembered much as I read and found the author's presentation interesting. (I still get furious over the destruction of the library of Alexandria.)

Many of the other reviews do not take in account that this book was translated. Being bilingual myself and having read many translations of different languages over the decades, it is difficult to translate from language to another if the translator isn't native in both. There are no literal translations sometimes, and colloquialisms are local, not global. Although I found this book to be clear; a very good, smooth translation.

I found the various conquests of Jerusalem enlightening, factually accurate, and thought provoking. As I've not read much Kabbalah literature, I just went with the surmises of the author.

3487,5,A1029ESOR657OQ,B00JMHT0K8,"This is a jim dandy of a mystery set in modern day Israel,  featuring Elijah, a scholar of ancient languages and texts.  The written word.  He doesnt much care about the content.  He is into scripts, and their wiggles and serifs and forms and handwriting styles of the ancients.  He is also a student of the various conquests of Jerusalem, the history of this ancient city.

He is a modest guy, living a modest life, hoping to get tenure at the university where he teaches.  He is called into the office of his superior and given a special assignment to assist an outside source in authenticating a manuscript which the person wishes to buy.

It turns out to be a manuscript of the Kabbalah, which is an esoteric method, discipline, and school of thought that originated in Judaism.  Traditional practitioners believe its earliest origins pre-date world religions, forming the primordial blueprint for Creations philosophies, religions, sciences, arts, and political systems.

As Elijah examines the manuscript, which is a photocopy,  and declares the original to be authentic, the potential buyer sends him to look at another example in Hong Kong.  There, he discovers a discrepancy in one line.  He also is the target of attempted murder.  Egad.  This career of studying ancient scripts can be downright hazardous to your health!

After looking at a couple more manuscripts, and finding differences in that same line, Elijah figures out that these different lines make up a code.  And that the guy who has hired him is out to change the world by occult and magic means, using the code found in the manuscripts.

We are introduced to Nashs equilibrium point, which is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players, in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy.  How this applies to our rabid manuscript collector and the idea of the redemption of the world,  is one of the great threads of this plot.

I love the way this book is written, its structure.  Each chapter opens with a different conquest of Jerusalem, starting with the British conquest in 1917, and moving backward in time and in the history of the city.  At the end of the book, we see the relevance of these to the entire story.

3492,5,A2A1GRZL896QTF,B00JNQKR8W,"Madly by Ruthie Knox is the second book in her New York series, and one I've been anticipating for a while. The two main characters have been been introduced previously in other stories by the author and are not a pairing I would have ever guessed would happen, but the result is a delightful mix of British charm and American bravado in an emotional and sexy romance.

Winston Chamberlain doesn't quite know how he ended up where he is now - in New York, divorced, barely keeping up with his college attending daughter whom he followed to America. Long workaholic days keep him from thinking overly much about where his decidedly dismal life is headed. Stepping into a pub one day changes all that in one fell swoop.

Allie Fredericks is on a mission. She's followed her midwestern mother from Wisconsin all the way to New York and is determined to discover once and for all where her mother disappears to periodically for weeks at a time, and why. Her worst fears are that she's having a long term affair, a belief reinforced by the knowledge that she's not the biological child of her father but of an artist known as Justice. With a little ingenuity (and inappropriate password use) she's tracked her mom and Justice to a bar and is keeping a covert eye on them out of sight, until the tall, handsome Brit walks into the bar and impedes her view. Just like that, Winston is drawn into Allie's spy game. One thing leads to another and a sexy fling ensues while Allie tries to find out what her mom is up to. But New York isn't home for either of them. When the adventure is over, is their time together destined to become just a bittersweet memory?

I loved this story! Allie's impetuous decision to follow her mother to New York has real life consequences. Having previously left a groom at the altar, a man who continues to insinuate himself into her life back home to her dismay (he's a nice guy, everyone says so!), and now planning a wedding anniversary party for her parents that might not happen, she's in a bit of panic. Winston, drawn into her spy game, becomes a steadying influence for her. She ends up staying at the apartment he'd gotten for his daughter Bea (who insists on living at her college dorm). Two strangers, they have a surprisingly easy camaraderie that results in sharing some intimate secrets, and this leads to a list  yes, that kind of list (wink, wink). With no vested interest in the outcome of each others lives (at least at first), they can confide anything to each other without fear of reprisal or condemnation. I really enjoyed watching them open up to each other, both sexually and emotionally.

While Winston and Allie are growing closer, there are significant happenings going on in their family relationships. Winston's struggles to be a worthy father to Bea, and a better brother to Nev (whose relationship to his partner Cath he almost destroyed) are noteworthy. He really wasn't that nice of a guy before, and only since his divorce and move to New York has he come to grips with the mistakes he's made. Allie is not at all a woman he would have ever considered dating before, but her refreshing candor and zest for life draw him in.

Allie has her own challenges, her relationship with her sister May fraught with tension and resulting in several emotional scenes. Her confusion and worry over her mother's actions, and the knowledge that her father is not related to her biologically lead her to make several decisions that aren't necessarily the right ones, though it's only in her trying to fix everything and make everyone else happy that she realizes how miserable she is. The author has a wonderful way of drawing you into her characters and making you feel invested in the outcome of everyone's lives, not just the main couple.

There are some surprising twists and turns in the second half of this delightful story, and some tears, laughter and joy when all's said and done. Everyone gets a happy ending, including Winston and Allie. Madly is a delightful romp exploring family and friendship and love in Ruthie Knox's unmatched style.",Delightful opposites attract romance!,3,3/21/2017

It's been a while, a LONG while since I've read any of Ruthie's books, and it's all her fault, since I've read everything she published and so I was waiting patiently for a new release. So I was already pumped about this book, THEN I learnt that the MC in this one is no other than Nev's bigger brother from ""About Last Night"" which is probably my favorite book by Ruthie (and one of the first I've read by her). Keeps getting better and better without me even starting to read hehe I LOVED Winston in this one even if he was ""the villain"" in Nev and Cath's book. Let's just say he had his reasons and he managed to make amends with his brother (and partner). Now 5 years later it's time for him to find HIS happiness with the colorful Allie we've met in the previous installment - May's little sister.

In May's book - ""Truly"" Allie decides the very last minute NOT to marry Matt. She is portrayed as reckless, colorful and energetic so I was already intrigued to get her POV on what happened with Matt and with her life in general. Yet there is so much more to Allie than that. I truly envy her. She might sound as someone who screws up all the time but it's only because she keeps on trying, changing, evolving. Though Winston sounds like the exact opposite this is part of what makes her appeal to him so much. There is so much going on with this brave girl it's no wonder he fell for her and her unique outfits he adores because they are so HER. But it's also no wonder Allie fell for Winston who is such an incredible guy. Yeah he made a lot of mistakes in life but he's doing his best now to redeem himself to his daughter, in a way with his ex-wife, her brother and his partner. What he sees in Allie awakens him in a beautiful way. I would have surely fallen for a guy like him. Mature, who knows what he wants and not because he's ""too good"" because now he knows better, the kind of guy who respects people even though he comes from a ""high class"".

The most beautiful and main part of the book - Allie and Winston finding their way to one another and to committing to one another was perfection. It was fun, engaging, sexy. It was emotional without being overwhelming, it was genuine and sweet. It was everything I could have asked for and more. I loved Allie and Winston alone and together and enjoyed seeing them circle around each other, getting closer and closer, not realizing they are past the no return to falling in love.

The relationships in this book were so realistic, I SO enjoyed seeing not only Allie and Winston but also how both of them deal with their family members. Winston and Nev finding a way to become brothers again, Nev even putting Winston on the spot a few times. May and Allie confronting one another on the secrets they kept from one another but in the end loving each other SO dearly. Ben and May, being so much in sync, and grumpy Ben even doing his best to help Allie explain herself to May so they could forgive each other. Even Winston's driver and PA were a nice add to the mix and that without mentioning Bea - Winston's daughter and the color she added. I could see her and Allie becoming best friends and Winston is a really good father even if he believes he isn't really.

The thing that brings Allie and Winston together is a chance meeting at a bar while Allie is spying on her mother. That's the ""main story"", which I started by being very interested in and later on got annoyed and even disinterested in the whole prospect. I HATED Allie and May's mother. She can win the worst mother of the year the whole 30 years she's been a parent. She is SO self centered. What good did she do to her two daughters? she discouraged them, ignored them when they needed her most, hurt their feelings and was generally annoyed by them. I am NOT a mother myself and frankly I don't wish to be, but if I HAD kids, I wouldn't treat them as a nuisance I have to bear with - THIS is how May and Allie's mother treats them and even though the story has a sort of happy ending with her, I HATED the way it was portrayed because in the end they didn't get any answers from HER, because she had other more important things to do than to have a moment with her family who were always there for her even at the (many) times she abandoned them. I WILL say, she technically had a good reason to ""run away"" from home like she did this time and in the many times she did in the past, but her reasoning was lost on me. She behaved like a child. There are FAR better ways to deal with situations you aren't able to explain yourself fully. All that being said, this part of the story, though moved the plot along wasn't the main issue, at least for me, which is why I was able to enjoy this book so much and put this whole nuisance aside (but it did made me reduce half a star from my rating).

I don't know on who the next book is going to be about but I already can't wait to have my hands all over it! Great book! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)

3494,3,A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2,B00JNQKR8W,"In the past I've found Ruthie Knox to be a very entertaining writer, with an ability to create unusual plots carried along by humorous dialogue between likable characters. The plotting and dialogue are still here, but the characters aren't particularly likable, which makes this a far less engaging read than her earlier books. I would also say the book verges on erotica rather than romance, as perhaps a third of it consists of sex scenes.",Unlikable characters,2,3/18/2017
3495,5,A994BXN6UVHTW,B00JNQKR8W,"After reading Truly, and subsequently every Ruthie Knox book available, I was shrouded in complete giddiness anticipating the release of Madly. It took a bit, but it was well worth the wait.

What I appreciate and value most in a Ruthie Knox romance is the human connection, the human interaction. She writes real, down to earth, extraordinary characters. Ones who are discovering who they truly are. Who they truly want to be. She has this uncanny ability to write in such a way that you see a little of yourself in her characters. Understand what they are going through. Understand where they've been. It's that ability, that extra special factor that makes me devour her books.

Madly was funny, sweet, endearing. It was sexy and intense and swept me up thoroughly. I loved Allie Fredericks in all of her colorful glory. I adored Winston Chamberlain in his beautiful, buttoned-up way. They are the cutest, most honest couple I've read about in a long time.

Love is messy and scary and not some picture perfect fairytale. It's different for everyone and this love story, this story about a girl trying to fix her family illustrates the beauty behind the chaos that is second love. A chance at love again. Allie left her fiance the day of her wedding. Winston is divorced. Somehow they meet and it turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to them.

Josh needs a wife, now, so he could adopt his niece and nephew. He asks Oliva, but she is reluctant. Josh still has feelings for Charlie but keeps it to himself. Drama plays out.
Charlie moves to NYC to attend law school and still has feelings for Josh. That drama plays out.

My Thoughts
Five-Star Great. I enjoyed entering into the world of the Best family. Here are two lines from the book and of course, its much better in context. That was before I knew you were insane. And We should write a book about it.

Other lines I loved:
Charlie stood trembling like a skittish doe.
Charlie schooled her face to hide her emotional turmoil.

The characters were characters.
Gram  Shes a force of nature. I loved her determination and drive. I wouldnt dream of interfering, she says. Why dream when you can have the real thing?
Charlie  The girl thinks too much, making her funny.
Josh  He listens to the wrong advice and doesnt communicate his feelings to the one person who matters.

Put the other characters on stage, all who like to interact or interfere in their friends lives, and a funny story emerges.
I laughed, became excited, and cried at different scenes. Read this book and you, like me, will want to scream at the characters, TALK TO EACH OTHER.

As the owner of DreamMakers Inc., Parker Wilson takes the skills he learned as a Ranger to help men win in the love department, using every resource available to plan the perfect date. Partners Dean and Jack were special op soldiers with Parker. They plan extravagant dates and events for helpless boyfriends or husbands who don't have the imagination to do it themselves. It sounded like a feasible plot until the date planning became about Parker dating one of his clients.

The characters were shallow and only interested in sex. Every activity included sex. Every conversation included sex. Every look led to sex. Lynn unexpectedly partook in sex for fun by becoming adventurous with Parker. Parker's character came across as a sex guru rather than a dating assistant.

Lynn's boyfriend Phil hired the DreamMakers team to plan a fantasy date for him and Lynn. While conducting recon on Lynn, Parker and Dean met up with Lynn and ended up exploring her sexual attributes.

The story lacked background information about Phil and Lynn's relationship. There was a disconnect with these characters that did not fit into the storyline.

It was an insta-sexual just met lets screw story. Forget the character building and focus on how wet she was and how crazy she made him. He wanted sex with her all the time. He became possessive and dominant.
Where do these guys find these clients? Fetish R Us. The story seemed to focus on announcing as many sexual fetishes as it could. It included menage, bi-sexuals, lesbians, swingers, and voyerism.

Krista Lakes writes like a teenager that grew up on a steady diet of Disney.  Everything is the most beautiful, awesome, wonderful thing ever; or the complete opposite most awful, horrible, ugly thing ever.  She uses adjectives with abandon, which don't necessarily go with what she is trying to say. This makes me stop and wonder what she is trying to convey and knocks me out of the story.  Her male characters are just like the princes in Disney.  They show up, kiss the girl, and instantly want to marry her.  There is no more character development for the male H.  Her earlier books had very awkward love scenes.  In this book, it appears that Krista has been reading some erotica, and is trying to include it here.  So her love scenes are now different, but still awkward.  She confuses infatuation with love, and all her books end at the wedding (just like Disney) where they all live happily ever after.  This read was so boring and predictable that I wanted to skip parts, but I paid $5 for this, so I wanted my moneys worth.  There was nothing about this story that was surprising or even remotely believable.  Krista does not do her homework well, so she often writes about things she does not know, which makes people like me cringe, and knocks me out of the story while I complain.  Sandcastles do not survive the tide.  You defend a dissertation, and write a grant proposal.  If you're going to write about something, please study it a little bit.

3516,2,A2M2F48XEPJ2ST,B00JRDGZN2,"Mists of the Past (Book 2)
Darcy Sweet, psychic bookstore owner and mystery lover, is back!

Now, shes dating the police detective (how clich) and something from his past is haunting him. Well, not literally, but there was this unsolved case that prompted his move to Darcys town. Now, hes getting threatening letters and he thinks the killer is in town, so the couple must work together to solve this old case.

Basically, the story involved talking to old ghosts of the past. It was slow and centered mostly on the lovey dovey couple, which was very distracting. Very anticlimactic in the end.

From the Ashes (Book 3)
Darcy is helping a young girl, who is haunted by her mothers death. Again, not literally, but the mother supposedly died in a house fire and the daughter just wants closure. What could she have seen that day that spooked her? What really happened to the mother? Could she actually still be alive?

This one starts a lot quicker than Book 2. I enjoyed the mystery concerning the mothers death and the fire.

The Ghost of Christmas (Book 4)
An angry ghost comes knocking on Darcys door, seeking justice for his murder. Apparently he was murdered on Christmas 20 years ago. And things between her and Jon are bumpy, which was good! I thought the couple was too perfect, which is dull.

Could the guy have been killed by the Santa suit? Was the suit haunted? Mmmm. This was an interesting angle, if only you didn't have all the Christmas crap.

The Stolen Valentine (Book 5)
The Season of Love  Blah!

Too much V-Day. Again, this had a slow start. It doesnt get interesting until Chapter 5 with the missing brother-in-law, but the mystery was just too dull to keep up.

Hiding from Death (Book 6)
Another slow one. It just seems that each book after the first just kept getting less and less supernatural. I mean, Darcys a psychic for godsakes!

Would like to see more of Aunt Millie, and I thought for sure the way book one ended with the Smudge's perspective chapters that Smudge would have a heavier role. As with many cozy amateur sleuths, Darcy spends quite a bit of time closing her shop or leaving it in her assistant's hands, especially considering she keeps mentioning the loss of sales to ebooks (I happened to read the kindle version, lol). Read it as a cozy, and you'll be fine. Read it as a mystery, and you might find yourself veering toward incredulity.

Death Comes to Town
-Reread this one just to catch up on the story thus far before diving in...remembering that Smudge the cat is crazy stacked in the paranormal dept...maybe more than Darcy. Or maybe they enhance each other. Who knows. Nice end chapter from the cat's perspective, especially going back through pretty much the entire story, pointing out where Darcy didn't quite catch on. Darcy's neighbor is murdered, and she worms her way into the investigation since her sister is a policewoman.

Mists of the Past
 -On her first date with Jon, Darcy gets a vision and just ups and leaves. Later, she tells him, ""'I didn't think, I just ran out and took a cab home'"" and he's fine with it (loc 2608). Seriously? And she continues to investigate his past, which only solidifies their relationship? I guess it's nice to see that her ""feelings"" aren't always right. Darcy is very jumpy here. The dynamic between Jon and Darcy is sweet, but he's not very professional. They're investigating, and they're about to storm the bakery, and he tells her to wait outside...she says no, of course, and he acquiesces, saying, ""'Okay, but stay behind me and do as I say'"" (loc 3457). Really?

From the Ashes
-Darcy's mom is in town...and she's being nice. Written as weird since we haven't met the mom before. Darcy is trying to help a young woman figure out what happened in the fire that stole her mom as a child...but when Darcy can't make contact with the mom on the other side, she thinks maybe she's still alive.

The Ghost of Christmas
-Santa comes to Darcy in a vision and wants her to solve his murder. Right around the time Darcy agrees that she & Jon will play Mrs and Mr Claus, she finds out the santa suit may be haunted.

The Stolen Valentine
-Darcy's brother-in-law Aaron goes missing while running his Valentine's Day errands. When Darcy & Jon investigate, it turns out he may have been kidnapped from a bank with another man. When the other man ends up in a hospital as a John Doe because he's lost his memory, Darcy helps him get his memory back in her efforts to find Aaron.

Hiding from Death
-Darcy is trying to get to know her new neighbor, but she's very reluctant to even open her door. When Darcy pries (of course!), she finds out she may me wanted for murder.","Read it as a cozy, and you'll be fine.

You'll want to keep your imagination handy when navigating this unusual genre-crossing novel. Think Lord of the Rings meets The Day After. In the beginning, this seems like an entertaining survival-after-the-EMP story, with a U.S. Marine master sergeant from the American embassy in London taking the heroic leadership role.

The story moves along at a pleasant pace, and MSgt. Hogan surmounts obstacles and manages to survive in interesting and varied ways. Then, in a surprising turn, the plot veers into the world of Life-Light, the Fair-Folk, battle Orcs, and alien elvish conquerors.

Author Craig Zerf has melded these two disparate worlds together into one science fiction/fantasy story, and this is just the first book in the PULSE series. In fact, only at the end of Book One do we discover for certain who the Forever Man is. At that point, the stage is set and the curtain about to rise on Book Two.

The Marine realizes the Embassy will soon be under seize from the panicked populace. With current staff and supplies, the Embassy can't be defended. He recommends immediate evacuation, a concept the Ambassador rejects. This is a great first book. Not much happens in the first book with the magical characters, but the groundwork for them begins. Other interesting characters appear in this book. I think you will enjoy their real life type struggles and encounters with the Forever Man Marine.

3531,4,AZHD1MGJNVZ0I,B00JS732BK,"I really liked this book but it had a few small issues for me.

It reads like a mix between the Dies The Fire series and fantasy and alien invasion. Humanity is thrust back in time in essence after something (possibly solar flares) causes EMP like damage and nothing utilizing electrical power works anymore. Evidently it also impacts internal combustion as no mention is made of older vehicles functioning either. However unlike Dies The Fire firearms still function.

The issues (for me) pop up immediately. When referring to the U.S. Marines and members of such, the term Marine is capitalized. Always. The main protagonists rank varies from Master Sergeant to Master Gunnery Sergeant. Two very different ranks. All military ranks should also be capitalized as well. I also have a minor issue with most of the Marines using British slang and speak. They would have picked up and utilize some (we always do) but most likely not as much as they do.

The Master Guns abandoning his post is a small issue as it is very unlike a Marine to do so, especially one of such rank. However we discover further on that he is under a compulsion and hence it becomes a bit more understandable.

We also discover via dialogue that magic is now active and in the past was as well. Some of the devices used are extremely reminiscent of Dies The Fire and I personally have no problem with this.

The author is not shy of showing how the bad side of humanity will surface and most likely outnumber the good side. Plenty of action and the body count is incredible from accidents, machinery ceasing to function and just plain bad people being bad people.

There are a few spelling issues but most seem to occur in the final third of the book and are rather minor in comparison to other ebooks. Also in comparison to some paper books I have read within the past few years to be honest.

The problem (for me) comes down to believability of the character arc. There's just so much tell and not show, and they change their minds ) and motivations on a whim. There's waffling. I get that first person can be a lot of stream of consciousness. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to get behind a character who says, ""I don't want to cross the line from professional involvement to personal"" and then, a couple of scenes later, tells him to talk her out of that stance. Either she has conviction or not.

There's multiple examples of that: he doesn't know what draws him to her. He says that over and over for the first fifty pages or so.

It was really interesting to see events that we have seen in the past from another point of view. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. However, the editing of the book is another thing altogether. I am not talking about typos, although this addition to the series had quite a bit more than previous books. It is the frequent, jarring lack of continuity. Albinck tries to explain away prior errors, but is not entirely successful. Facts from previous books are incorrectly recalled in this book, a complaint that I have had with all of the books.  In addition, there are summaries of events that happened just a few chapters before, which are irritating. There is one chapter where a character, Eva, keeps popping in and out as if Albrinck kept forgetting that she was a member of the group of characters in that chapter. She would say something and then disappear when Albrinck was reviewing all the characters present, then say something again a dozen paragraphs later. She was so silent and absent that, at one point, when she spoke, I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see where she came from. It was frustrating, because it took me out of the story. In another chapter, he has the viewpoints of several characters, but then starts a section with ""he"" never identifying who the pronoun referenced. Again, I had to stop the flow of the book to figure out whose point of view I was supposed to be experiencing. Finally, the are a few bits of just clunky writing. My favorite was on page 5:  ""The crack was certainly noticeable, not something he could leave alone and expect it to remain unnoticed."" Wow! I am glad that he noticed the crack. This could have been a five star book, and series, but for these consistent editing errors.

I did not finish this. There were several things that put me off and made me put it down.

The Bad
I'm all for alpha males and macho men, but when you drug someone, kidnap them, and force them to have feelings for you - that's not love. That's Stockholm Syndrome. Luke pretends to be interesting in the bar, but then drugs Rebecca's drink, kidnaps her and holds her hostage when she tries to escape - all because he thinks she's his mate? Nope. Nada.

I had forgotten all of Hailey's shortcomings such as the leaden conversations and the tendency of characters to stand around giving each other lectures. He wasn't much of a prophet, either, but no matter. He could plot a plot that keeps you turning pages to see what happens next, even if you feel slightly embarrassed to be caught up in the melodrama.

Will the hotel owner find the funding he needs before the mortgage comes due and he is forced to sell his only hotel to the man who owns a chain of cookie-cutter hotels? and so on and on.

Katz introduced us to his gifts of the mind through a fictional, suspenseful story.  This was a wonderful way to challenge our thought processes--and teach something without actually teaching or preaching.

I loved the author's writing style and I loved the character interaction.  Everyone was open to new experiences--and everyone had a curious spark for learning.  This was the perfect setting for this novel.  I couldn't put it down--and I found his perspectives interesting, and perhaps even feasible and reasonable for my own life.

Would I recommend Five Gifts for the Mind by Eran Katz?  I love learning about the mind and the brain's potential.  I love learning even more when I don't feel that I'm back in my college psych or sociology lectures.  This book is perfect for anyone--at any level of education--to consider the gifts and the possibilities of the mind.

While it's not a ""self help"" book--so to speak--I think the writing style and format makes it so accessible to such a wide audience that it suits its goals perfectly.

Pardon me for out-of-ordinary comments.

The intention of the author for producing this book is clearly challenging.

Personally, I don't think that He wanted to publish a book.
I have a serious doubt that by this book,
He wants the reader
to respect every faith and religion in this world,
look deep into the words the faiths carry,
make the reader understand that there have been very wise people who have lived before our times,
and most importantly,
amazingly big feats are possible by rational, simple and strategic steps.

That apart,
What makes this book very readable and interesting are,

- The interesting way the book is planned

- The choice of language

- Plainness in presentation

- The story method

- Allowance of reasoning with the reader's psyche

This book was offered for free and it sounded interesting. The very next day, I had an email from the author asking me if I would like a free copy in exchange for a review. Yeah, weird and meant to be.
I love this book, the first of what may well be a three trilogy series. I will state from the outset that this is fantasy and a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief is required if you are going to enjoy the book.
The story begins as a school bus filled with six kids, all of whom have experienced their own sort of high school problems, enters a tunnel where a military vehicle has overturned and is then hit by another vehicle. An ensuing flash sends a wedge of the bus, the mountain and the tunnel to another world, perhaps another dimension. It is one where magic is real and, over time, they are met by a wandering/lost magic student on his way home via his wagon. He has some rather neat tricks up his sleeve. He sees that some of the six are injured and offers to take them to healers he has heard of. They agree.
Eventually they decide to bed down in a forest where the  healers are said to be, but the forest is covered by a tarp of some sort. What ensues involves healers, dwarves, elves and each of the students unknowingly acquiring special powers. I won't reveal them here because that would be a spoiler.
Let it be said that the seven find themselves healed and taken under the protection of the new people they have met. They are taken to the Ironhouse Mine, the ancient home of this tribe of dwarves. They learn that they have been dropped into the middle of an invasion of the land where they found themselves. As it turns out, they are all meant to play an important, but very challenging part in the winning of this war.
Lauren, the only girl, typically self-consumed as are so many teens in high school, has been given very special powers, is taken to the very depths of the mine, and is told she is to name a very special sword, which the legendary Weapons Master nearly went mad, even breaking one of the forges, to construct. The strange thing is the dwarves are four feet tall, and the sword is six feet long! Lauren names it ""Tranquil Fury"" because she senses a battle going on in the very soul of the sword. She also names Eric, a six foot plus tall and over two hundred pound football player, its champion and makes a dire prediction as to what will happen.
If that is  not enough to get you to start reading this trilogy (I've already bought the other two books and all of the ensuing trilogy), then perhaps this is not for you. However, if you enjoy high fantasy, with coming of age very cleverly woven into the story, then get this book and start reading.
I must caution about one part that makes the reading challenging. The dwarves and elves and the healer all speak a sort of ""Middle English"" which can be a bit frustrating and the author is not always consistent with his usage of this form of speech. But this does not interfere with the amazing, page-turning adventure unfolding for the reader.

3563,5,A2MSZE23MOYURE,B00JXO5JUA,"Usually, the second book of a trilogy is good, but is really just a transitional piece, with some few juicy bits, keeping the reader hooked so they will buy the third book.
That is simply not the case here. ""Sky Elf"" is filled with adventure, surprises (we find out who ""IT"" is). As they travel south having buried Earth Mother and fearing being trapped in the IronHouse mine, they are met with horrible events. Certain of their number are captured and tortured by the black-clad soldiers.
Moving at a pace that will cause you to lose sleep, more adventures ensue, with the Prophecy of Tranquil Fury, the sword, starting to manifest. Lauren continues with her struggle to accept all that comes with being Earth Mother, is in and out of action. As I said in my review of ""Tranquil Fury"", Mr. Thomas has cleverly intertwined a coming-of-age story arc within all the frantically paced action.
This book is no typical middle book in a trilogy; Sky Elf ups the ante, provides more and more action and mystery and does not merely hold the interest of  the reader so s/he will be sure to read book three; Sky Elf is as good, if not better than Tranquil Fury. I must add that another cleverly intertwined story arc is that the main characters from Earth, all high schoolers, also get to learn civics and politics up close and experientially. This while the action to eliminate the threat from the Royal House (the bad guys) is proceeding. Traitors are flushed out and dealt with rather harshly.
The final thing I want to say is that the title of this book, Sky Elf, only makes sense at the very end, when it is learned that.... No, that would be telling. You have to read it for yourself to find out. If you read and enjoyed Tranquil Fury, then Sky Elf will only pull you into the story deeper and send you seeking the final book, Blood Bond, so quickly that your head will spin.
I believe we are seeing the emergence of a master story-teller in P.G. Thomas.
Get it, read it. One final note, your must read Tranquil Fury in order to fully understand the relevance and importance of all that takes place in Sky Elf.",By far the best middle book in a trilogy since Tolkien,2,8/25/2016

Both are worthy of no less than four 's.  I loved how Ms. Zanetti hogtied me to the plot(s) of these two sisters of enhanced abilities within the first paragraph.  No kidding.

The third story&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tempted-Dark-Protectors/dp/B006MLKZWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tempted (Dark Protectors)</a>&nbsp;is a 90 page novella worthy of three 's . It's fast paced and loaded with drama and insta-love. It's over right when the gettin' gets good.  But, it's a novella so I expected nothing less.

The fourth story&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hunted-Dark-Protectors-Book-3/dp/B006YBRF3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hunted (Dark Protectors Book 3)</a>&nbsp;was Conn Karys and Moira Dunnes story and mostly about paranormal politics and war strategy with various battles mixed in. The story would take one step forward and two or three back and it became tiresome. It's conveyed extremely well so I'd rate it four 's for that reason alone.  But the romance part of the story was secondary and because of that, it became boring and I didn't think I'd ever finish it.

All the stories are about Vampires, Witches, Demons and Shifters.  The characters are well described making connection instantaneous.  Ms. Zanetti paints a fearsome picture of the bad guys...The Kurjans, (who kidnap human women with enhanced abilities to either mate with or experiment on).  The Kurjans have an evil agenda of taking over the world.  Their evil intent really caused my anxiety to spike.  Awesome!  The good guys are Vampires called ""The Protectors"" of the Sanguisuga race and war is imminent between them and the evil disgusting Kurjans.  In the middle of all this, biochemical warfare is plotted.  A deadly virus has been released by the Kurjans and some of the mates of the good guys have been infected.  So, there's a lot going on.  Love relationships are worked through in the midst of all the drama and excitement and the bow-chukka-bow-wow is good and steamy without overpowering the plot(s).  I loved all these vampire brothers (Dage, Talen, Conn, Kane and Jase).  I mean, for crying out loud!  They're almost 7 foot tall testosterone menaces.  The heat was pretty great.

What I didn't like was how the author reiterated strategic points of interest each time a new character was introduced.  Sometimes this is good and reestablishes what's going on in the midst of all the controversy.  But it became too much and I felt like I was rereading the same thing over and over.  I liked how the romance aspect of each story was concluded at the end of the story, but the war/biochemical problem wasn't.  You have to read the second..nope, wait, third?  Nope...I read four books and I'm still wondering what happens and who wins.  So, it's a partial cliff hanger.  There's several typo's and misspelled words, but nothing that detracts from the meaning of the sentence structure.  There are a few holes and loose threads (why didn't King Dage tell Emma about her scientist friend dying?)  There are situations of intelligent women acting stupid or making out of character, senseless decisions.  But the characters are impressively good, especially the Alpha Vampires.  The storyline is addicting and exciting.  Adult language is low.  Analogies, descriptions and details are vividly conveyed.  I'm just not sure if I want to continue reading if the story isn't concluded after four books.","Great action, suspense and steam..",2,6/4/2017
3565,4,A3391I7OFTKR5A,B00JXTNMDG,"This is between a 3 and 4 for me. I've only finished the first of this 4 book set and did enjoy the story line and world building. There is however, an immaturity to the writing style, a simplified melodrama overall that is somewhat off putting. Aspects of the characters that I wanted more development on were brushed aside. For example the 4 year old daughter of the heroine Cara, has the vocabulary and conversation level of a 12 year old child. Accepting her dialogue as a 4 year old wasn't possible. Cara walks into a room and can instantly see the smallest details of eye color from 10 feet away. The hero would rip her clothes to shreds one minute and in the cabin scene, she picks them off the floor and puts them back on. Despite this being a fantasy romance/erotic book, I needed more reality and believable writing where the characters are concerned to fully immerse myself in the book. I felt as if the author was trying to add depth to the small moments between characters but it fell short. The relationship between the couple was very instalove with a dominant, ""Me man, you my woman!"", alpha vibe. Cara accepts this very quickly with little to no protest. I can live with this dynamic but a little more sexual tension and longing in the beginning wouldn't hurt. I was frustrated with how little Cara protested his manhandling of her and even when she did try to speak up for herself, the constant discussion of the state of her panties was was over the top.",Alpha cavemen with vampire insurgent styling.,8,11/29/2016

The two main characters could be great but they lie and trick each other over and over. The girl also seems naively foolish as she still pines over a man who was using her and was going to rape her.

Our trio gets lured into a freak tent that isn't just ripping people off of their money, but of their lives. Atticus faces off against a Grim Reaper who is literally creating hell on Earth.

And I absolutely could not wrap my head around The Paris move.. What was her end game..lose the most sought after millionaire hootie, and for what reason. Why push the limits pass the breaking point.

No. He will never get back the years with the other kids, but he was making a difference. The other thing that made me laugh was the diametrically opposites in the three women.

Why she needed to go to Paris for 6 months and be in the company of a man she knew Chris had an issue with, this had me shaking my head.. At the end of the story the words I used to describe Robyn were-selfish, foolish, and detached from her power. The words for Chris- petulant, loving, and in the end... amazingly patient.

Sophie is a charming lady, but disaster seems to follow her wherever she goes; therefore, she has become a wallflower with no potential suitors in sight.  Christopher believes that he will never have love.  He is hiding an affliction that makes him feel undeserving of another woman's love.  Christopher's father threatens to expose his affliction to ruin him if he son does not adhere to his command to marry Sophie, because his father has gotten himself deeply in debt.  He needs his son to marry Sophie because of her large dowry which no one else knows about.  Christopher's past with Sophie is not pleasant, and he comes up with a scheme involving his best friend, the Duke of Mallen to help him get out of his father's greedy plan.  Christopher wants Mallen to pretend to court Sophie, but all of the sudden Christopher sees things in Sophie that he never noticed before and things get very interesting.

That being said, the following issues had me delaying this review until I'd read more of the series. I was hoping something in the later books would vindicate the disgusting suppression of women. Unfortunately, the misogyny only gets worse in later books. Minor spoilers ahead.
While reading The Queen, I was disturbed by Amberly's utter devotion to Clarkson. She was in love with the image of the prince she had built up in her own mind, not the actual flesh and blood incarnation she ended up marrying. Unfortunately, she had blinded herself too much to see him in anything other than a positive light.
And Clarkson himself isn't any better. He didn't want a Queen. He wanted a totally devoted subject, a slave he could control dressed in the guise of royal garb. This mental abuse only gets worse in The Elite where it is revealed the abuse has turned physical against their son Maxon.
Maybe there's some all redeeming event that occurs in the lady book to wipe away this maltreatment, but I honestly can't see the silver lining that is going to undo years of trauma. And I honestly can't see this (series) being a good read for young, impressionable girls who don't have enough experience yet to know that Clarkson's behavior is unacceptable.

3582,5,A24353XS3ETLWU,B00JZWDC9K,"A refreshing difference in a shifter story for me.  Roth definitely captured my interest first with the cover and then with the story itself.  A realm inhabited by bird shifters that could be looking at the end of their race if their King didn't fulfill the prophecy handed down.  Kabril wanted to do what was best for his people, but take a human as mate?  It was up to Sachin, not only an advisor to Kabril but a long time friend, to get Kabril to adhere to what was set for him.  The one thing he didn't tell Kabril was that he knew who this human mate was.

Rayna didn't really want to go but she needed to say goodbye one last time to the house she had sold belonging to her grandmother.  She was to meet the new owners, welcome them, and then leave.  That isn't exactly what happened when she showed up with a plate of chicken divan and horrified Sachin, but during the discussion Kabril shows up and immediately says they can leave now that he has found the one.  Rayna has no idea what he is talking about and Sachin tells him ""no"" that it isn't yet time.  Should Kabril have picked up on that evasive response.  Maybe, but his head wasn't on what Sachin was saying.

Kabril is introduced as a vet and Rayna immediately says he could probably help with ""Henry"".  AND the courtship begins with Kabril telling Henry that he will help him after sending Rayna to her house, but gets a rude awakening when he tries to kiss her after all is done and she slaps him.  Nothing like this has ever happened to him before and he asks Sachin for advice.

Over a period of time things change for both Rayna and Kabril.  He continues to try and control himself and Rayna now wishes he wouldn't.  Sachin finds all it quite funny until they are in the jungle supposed to do research for Kabril and come under attack.  His enemies have found them; Rayna is taken to Kabril's realm with the intent to kill her, but ended up with a soft hearted enemy who planned to return her to her home after spilling the beans about Kabril and their kind.  While cleaning his wound a couple baddies come and try to eliminate him and take control.  Not gonna happen as far as Rayna is concerned.  Though one was dispatched, the other had ideas of his own while Rayna tried to save the one trying to help her.  A swift kick to the family jewels gave her the time needed to dive in after her fallen savior.

If Kabril didn't know she was his mate before he did when pain hit him warning that Rayna was in trouble and followed her signal.  In arrives the good guys, but Kabril dives into the water to save Rayna only to find she isn't breathing.  Once surfaced he yells to the Gods he had only recently disparaged to help bring her back to him.  Apparently they were listening.

There is so much more before and after this but I don't want to give it all away.  That would ruin the idea of you reading it for yourself and seeing what a talented author Roth truly is.

King Kabril, King of the Buteos Regalis is a bird shifter, specifically a hawk.  His kingdom has been suffering.  There have been no new children born in years.  The streets no longer carry the sounds of childrens laughter.  Morale is low, people are unhappy.  It is prophesied that King Kabril must go to the human realm of earth and he will find his mate there. After he is accepted by his mate, the rest of his kingdom will once again bear young.  Humans are looked down upon by Kabrils people.  For one thing, they don't have wings.  Another is that their life spans are so short.  But if this is the sacrifice Kabril must make, he will go, along with his trusted advisor, Sachin.

Rayna Vogel is a photographer.  She loves to photograph wildlife, specifically birds.  She has lost her grandmother and has sold her home.  She decided to be neighborly and take over a dish to welcome them.  She cant believe these two beautiful men she sold the house to.  Especially the one named Kabril.  Theres just something about him.

Thus begins Kabrils somewhat hilarious attempts to woo Rayna human style.  He falls for her right away and knows shes the one he wants, but she has to fall in love with him as well.

I choose this one.  She is most pleasing to the eye andwill birth fine sons.  She will make a perfect queen.

At the same time, danger from Kabril and Sachins realm has followed them to earth and this will put Rayna in danger if it is learned that she is important to him.

I loved this short book.  This is my first avian shifter story but no matter what sort of shifter it is, there is something so sexy about beautiful wings popping out of a mans back.  Kabril and Raynas courtship was so cute but what will happen when she finds out that Kabril is holding back some very important details about himself from her.  That hes not human at all.  Will Rayna accept him as her mate and save his kingdom?  I cant wait to read book two, Sachins story.

3584,3,AJVQTGMBF8PL1,B00JZWDC9K,"3.5 out of 5 stars, Kabril is the King of the Buteos Regalis (the hawk shifters) and has been told by his Oracle that his mate has been found. The only trouble (for him as he dislikes them) is that his mate happens to be human. Therefore, he travels to Earth's realm to meet his mate and ends up with Rayna, a wildlife photographer. As they get to know one another they form an extraordinary bond but once outside forces try to kidnap Rayna and what Kabril is finally comes to light will that bond keep their relationship together in the end?

This fast-paced read keeps you on your toes and laughing the whole way through. It's an erotic romance that I couldn't help but smile about; mostly because of Kabril's blunders. I appreciated that while this novel is fast-paced it didn't feel rushed, by skipping ahead throughout their romance made it so the reader can feel like Kabril and Rayna are building a memorable relationship. Together they were a unique pair, a pair that becomes a united front against anyone wanting to separate them while bringing out a lightheartedness into each others lives.

I recommend it to those who are fans of Ms. Roth and/or those who like humorous erotic paranormal romances!

3587,4,A3LEH416AV3VTU,B00K0JZKYW,"Set in 1832, this is the story of Anna Traverne, who is left penniless after her husband dies in Ceylon where they had a tea plantation. Now she and her 5-year-old daughter are at the mercy of her husbands brother, Graham, who, though married, wants Anna in his bed. She resists and is hiding away in the study one night when a man breaks in and tries to steal the Queens emeralds, a set of family jewels that was hidden away in a secret compartment.

It turns out the housebreaker is none other than Grahams half brother, Julian Chase, spurned by the family but who may, in fact, be the true heir. In a tussle, Julian flees and ends up in Newgate prison. Anna realizes Julian has left the emeralds and they are her ticket to a new life. She takes her daughter to Ceylon where Julian pursues her. Not only does he now need the emeralds that were once his mothers but he has been told the emeralds hold the key to his heritage.

Robards is a great storyteller and I was immediately drawn into Annas life. Bold, brash Julian has been wronged. Understandably he is an angry man and he means to take out his frustration on Anna. Loved them both.

Its a bit of a mystery and an exciting read with a nasty villain in Graham and some delightful secondary characters, including the former prostitute who is Annas friend, and Julians sidekick, a man whose life he once saved. Theres also a bit of Ceylons darker atmosphere thrown in, too.",A Mystery Surrounding Emeralds and Love on a Ceylon Tea Plantation!,8,8/15/2016

Try Forbidden Love.",Not very good,7,1/16/2016
3589,4,A1TMFRRJUMWWYS,B00K0PGPS6,"This is the fourth book of a fifteen book series. If you're like me, you enjoy a long series more than a stand-alone novel or trilogy - IF it's well-written and original.  This one is quite different; it's not often readers have an opportunity to discover interesting new worlds and entirely unique races, and there are many creative, unheard-of races in this series.  I'd highly recommend the Frostborn series to fans of the various Forgotten Realms sagas or any other fantasy series.

Problems:

1 - Lack of editing.  We've all been there. You're losing yourself in a great story, forgetting about reality for a little while, then BAM!  There's a typo, extra word, or missing word to ruin the flow, and as you do an involuntary double take the real world comes crashing back.  I've definitely seen much worse, but the number of errors throughout this series is still a shame.  If the author would just read over it once, or send it to a beta reader before publishing, his readers would have a much more enjoyable experience.

2 - Repetition.  Summarizing each main character's back story in every novel seems unnecessary; people aren't going to start from book ten and go backwards. Also, having characters explain a situation, then restate it multiple times is annoying.

3 - As others have pointed out, the hero Ridmark Arban is overused.  There's a whole group of colorful main characters here, but no matter how chaotic the fighting may become, it's usually Ridmark who strikes down a major enemy or accomplishes something significant.

PRAISE:

1 - Originality!  I'm 35 years old and have been an avid reader all my life, but I've never heard of at least half the races he introduces in this series. Bravo, Moeller!  Even the races we've seen before are so different in this story, they easily hold the reader's attention.

2 - Character development. As the Frostborn series progresses, so do many characters' personalities.  Moeller allows readers access to their inner thoughts, feelings, and struggles so we can watch them grow.  Though the repetition can be frustrating at times, I still appreciate those details and glimpses.

3 - Length of series.  Some reviewers have said the series is dragging on too much.  Personally, I enjoy the stalling and side adventures.  When I find a good series, I always hate reaching the end.  Moeller keeps his characters busy with unique, entertaining dilemmas and journeys.  I applaud his expertise in stretching things out while keeping his readers interested.",Worth a read,5,9/2/2016

I forgive these things as the action is always coming and exciting as it switches views from person to person.  From Ridmark's view and then to his companions alternately.  Most of it stays on Ridmark, Calliande, and Morigna; in this book it also focuses on Jager more than the other companions.
 Dangers, dangers everywhere and yet Ridmark and his companions are still blessed to survive yet can Calliande convince Ridmark that he does not deserve death when Imaria the sister of his late wife is still shouting ""murderer"" at him and after challenging Imaria to a test to prove that Calliande is a Magistria can Calliande find a way to forgive herself for being influenced by Imaria's thoughts and memories and screaming Imaria's conviction that Ridmark is a murderer and a coward and deserves death.  Some rest and Calliande is herself again, but Ridmark is colder.
As I said before Ridmark seems to pick up a new companion with every book and Jager will be in the next book as Ridmark and his companions strive to retrieve the soulstone Jager stole in hopes of freeing his lover Mara and then Ridmark promised to help free Mara from the Iron Tower.
Little do any except Jager know that Mara is fully capable of freeing herself if she uses the dark magic inside her as a half-breed bastard of her father a dark eleven prince and her mother one of his human concubines.  But she has been fighting back against using that magic or seizing that darkness inside herself; she does NOT want to be a monster and using that power would change her into that she would not want to be.
She is in a prison cell alone except a whisper says to her that she should use those powers and free them both and feed on the blood of their captors; in the next book will she succumb to those whispers and no longer be Jager's love or will she still be his loving Mara ready to be rescued.",Coldinium's challenge is met,2,6/4/2016

Then imagine that you are armed only with a knife, a camp ax, and what knowledge you have of survival techniques.
Could you, born in an age of easy abundance and labor-saving devices, survive? Would you be tough enough, swift enough, and lucky enough to last more than a day or two in a world in which you are no longer an apex predator but are, instead, prey for animals that are bigger, stronger, and faster than you?
Would you be psychologically strong enough to withstand long periods of loneliness in an extremely hostile environment?
And if you were, would you be able to hold on to enough of your civilized humanity to work with others if - and when - you came into contact with them?
Fascinating questions and the basis for Jack L. Knapp's excellent adventure novel ""Darwin's World: An Epic of Survival."" In it, Knapp has imagined a world that is an alternative Earth: One that exists across dimensions. He has populated it with men and women who have been ""transplanted"" to this planet during the Ice Age by Futurists, given minimal supplies, and then discreetly monitored. The reason: In the far future humanity is dying out and needs an infusion of stronger genes to survive. The Futurists reason that by placing people in this extremely harsh environment, only the strongest will survive. Those that do will later be ""harvested"" and brought back to the Earth that exists in their own dimension. Adding their more robust genes to the pool will, the Futurists think, ensure that humanity doesn't die out.
What made ""Darwin's World"" a really good read for me is Knapp's ability to fashion a wide-ranging narrative that is part primer on survival techniques and part sociological study on small group dynamics wrapped in a crackling good adventure. His world-building skills are impressive and his characters are well drawn. The situations they find themselves in are realistic as are their reactions to the threats they face. Knapp writes smoothly and effectively; there are very few wasted words in ""Darwin's World."" If I have any quibble with this novel - the first in a series - it is the fact that Knapp abruptly switches from first-person to omniscient narration near the end of the book. I understand why he did it but it was, nonetheless, a little jarring.
That aside, this is a very fine novel that asks, and answers, some interesting questions and gives readers something to think about. A solid 4.5 stars and a novel that I have no problem recommending.",A solid 4.5 stars,6,3/5/2016

Being a woman who likes action adventure books I didn't always understand the descriptions of how they made the wheels, horse bridles, reins & pad to sit on. It was interesting reading how they made glue & I didn't know you could without a recipe make flat bread?

I just couldn't wrap my head around women being prone to have sex with many men without a real doctor available! Maybe because I had difficulty with the delivery of our son.

I thought the characters were well written. Over the time of the two books many additional characters were added truthfully. I was delighted in the plot because of the authenticity of the problems the people had. And the writer didn't just use the bully as the only menace in their world.

Book 3 ""Home"" that I'm reading now is slow & not very interesting. I still don't know how they can build a permanent settlement in a canyon where there might be flooding? I hope the book will pick up the further I read.

3614,4,A217U7WZLK6H99,B00K27655A,"an all-new story about faith, love, and the tragedy that is war., from the authors synopsis.

The writers planet has been at war for so many years it no longer has hopeno faith that something different can take place. Two factions  one alien, one human - fight for dominance and purity in a world that could just have easily adopted acceptance and peaceful cohabitation of mingling species, but have chosen not to do so.

The main character, May  a long time warrior for the human faction - is given a glimpse into his future if he follows his current path.  Coralene, as his souls match and a being that appears to be non-human, is sent by a God he does not believe in to save him from that fate. May is given the dilemma by Coralene of accepting what she shows him versus accepting a predetermined journey of peace through belief in a higher power (with his own agenda).  After decades of fighting for what appears to be hopeless choice can he let go and accept the hope she shares?  Can he reconcile his love for Coralene with the future she shows him and believing what she tells him?

The story does not take long to read, yet, Mr. Avera has managed to create a complete vision of both the horror the prolonged wars bring and a well developed image of the two main characters.  Along with the tale of love, hope and belief in something unseen is the underlying message of acceptance of life in all its forms rather than a fight for supremacy over others.  I see this short story as a metaphor of things as they are on this planet today.the struggle for the right to live and believe as one chooses and accept the repercussions for the choices we make either way.

Soul Match does move back and forth in time such that the reader might find it a little disorienting, but in the final analysis will make sense.

They are just the kind of group anyone would want to be a part of. I loved each of them and Bella's story is sweet and frustrating and steamy as all heck.

Bella is in transition in many ways. She wants to make a career change and possibly move back to the island. She recently broke up with a coworker and doesn't want to make any future decisions based on a relationship with a man. So she's swearing off of men until she has her life firmly planted where she wants it.

There is romance in the air all over Seaside. Some people are in love, some want to be, and some are running like hell to escape.

3622,5,AYX4FFM42UGTM,B00K2BX8WY,"I'm new to Melissa Foster's world and seeing as how ""Seaside Dreams"" was on sale for FREE I grabbed it because it sounded like a great read. My hunch turned out to be right because the story of Bella and Caden surpassed my expectations.

I have a thing for single fathers in books. Maybe because my own father was absent or maybe because there is just something intrinsically sexy about a man willing to step up and take responsibility for his actions as well as the actions, or lack thereof, of the other party involved. Caden was FANTASTIC as a hero. He was strong, supportive, sexy and surprisingly soft-hearted. Especially towards his son Evan. Those are all things that bring me to my knees and Caden's character worked so well for me. As a police officer, Caden moved his only son to a smaller town with an almost non existent crime rate after the death of his partner George. The small town of Seaside is where he meets Bella and her gaggle of goofy, silly and fun friends.

If you have a strong male lead you need an equally strong female lead...right? Bella was that and then some. She was strong and fierce but at the same time her softer side kicked in perfectly to balance out her strength. I could really relate to her character in so many ways. A bad breakup with a co-worker kicked her into high gear and made her reevaluate her life choices and she decided to go for broke and start over in the place she's always felt HOME. She's the kind of woman who doesn't NEED a man to make her life complete but realizes that WANTING a man isn't going to be detrimental to her well thought out plans.

The relationship between these two was VERY hot and full of passion that had me captivated for more of them. It could just be because I haven't read anything steamy in a while but I'm betting on the fact that Foster knows how to structure love, romance and sizzling passionate chemistry to combine into a seriously enjoyable reading experience. Not only did these two build something strong that you could feel the entire time but they had some great sex! I am not a prudish reader by any means, and I don't necessarily need behind closed doors action but I appreciate someone who writes love scenes honestly and that flow organically and not something that feels forced or contrived. Foster did an excellent job blending romance and heat that has me panting for more of her Seaside series ASAP!

Aside from the heat though, Foster weaved a wonderful familial story between Caden, Bella and his son Evan that felt natural from all sides. Evan and Bella's friendship seemed to grow in a way that didn't force Bella into that step-mother role but as another parental figure to help shape his young mind. So, not only does a single father work for me but a strong woman who understands the kid comes first and yet still sticks it to the hero when he's being a butt-head about it all, does it for me as well. You really can't go wrong reading this book because it's got everything a romance reader craves with a delightful secondary cast of characters that has me wanting to go back and read the series that this one spun off from.",I just fell in love with Melissa Foster!,3,2/1/2016

They way she sucks you in so deeply into her stories, almost makes the reader feel they are right in the mix of things. Like they, themselves; are part of the story, too. I wanted to be part of the circle of close friends. I wanted to join them on the beach for their bonfires, and sunbathing. The story made me want to live next door to all these people and join in on all their neighborhood B.B.Q.'s, their B*tch sessions, and their nightly excursions....no matter whether they were legal or not!

Bella has sworn off men and committments of any kind, just after ending a relationship of lies and deception. She needs to get away and work on making herself happy again, before looking for love again. She heads to the Cape, the only place where she had ever felt happy. A place where all of her childhood friends gather each summer. But will that be enough to satisfy her wants and needs? Can she permantly build a new life there?

Caden and his son, Evan pack up and leave Boston, after his partner and best friend is killed in the line of duty. As a single parent; Caden wants to find somewhere that's a little bit safer to live and work. But three short months after moving to the small seaside town, Caden finds his hands full with his teenage son, who has developed a bit of a wild spirit at the moment. But Caden's not about to give up on him just yet. He has always been a very devoted father, always striving to be the best dad he can be. But after meeting Bella one night while he was on duty, he starts to wonder if he had been missing out on life. Dare heseek more, or should he wait until his son goes off to college to find his own happiness?

And even though neither was looking for the other, this magical small town of Seaside and all of it's wonderful charm, has a way of playing cupid to two people who need a love they can both finally believe in.","Loved Bella & Caden's story! Lots of fun and laughter thrown in, too.",2,1/21/2016

3644,4,AHO0FCJB59HW0,B00K2TYD9S,"Bonjour TristesseHello Sadness is a 1954 classic that I had just read. It describes the story of 17-year-old C&eacute;cile during summer vacation on the Riviera with her 40-year-old widowed father, Raymond, and his 29-year-old, vacuous, but kind mistress, Elsa.

C&eacute;cile spent ten years in a convent boarding school before returning to her father. Raymond worked in publicity, was charismatic, self-indulgent, and promiscuous. He kept young women for six months before moving on to his next conquest. C&eacute;cile, a cynic, loved life with her father who didn't appear to make a fuss at her failing grades. A positive was Raymond loved his daughter, was approachable and accessible; however, he was too permissive and didn't set rules and boundaries. C&eacute;cile enjoyed a whirlwind of adult parties and drinking with Raymond and his friends. He referred to C&eacute;cile as his little partner in crime.

The three, C&eacute;cile, Raymond and Elsa spent a happy summer on the Mediterranean. C&eacute;cile had met passionate Cyril, a college student who appeared enamored of her. Yet C&eacute;cile felt the shadow of their peaceful and idyllic summer was invaded when Anne Larsen arrived. Anne worked in fashions in Paris, and was a friend of C&eacute;ciles late mother.

C&eacute;cile admired 40-year-old, Anne, but felt inadequate in her presence. Anne was intelligent, sophisticated and cultured. She strongly disapproved of C&eacute;ciles behavior and grades. She demanded C&eacute;cile study for her next exam in the fall.

C&eacute;cile was not happy with how Anne had begun to rearrange their lives. Anne controlled her relationship with Cyril, and wheedled her way into Raymonds life. In no time, Anne seized Raymonds attentions from Elsa. With Elsa gone, love bloomed overnight between Raymond and Anne. Secretly, C&eacute;cile became sexually active with Cyril.

Raymond announced to C&eacute;cile that he and Anne would marry when they returned to Paris.

C&eacute;cile believed Anne would shatter their life of decadence, fun and merriment for a more controlled and cultured life. C&eacute;cile refused to accept this. She became a master schemer at manipulating her father, Cyril and Elsa, which wreaked havoc on what might have been bonjour bonheur.

I loved Sagans character Annes view on serial womanizers: they are no longer attractive or in good form. They cant drink anymore and they still hanker after women. Only then they have to pay heavily and lower their standards, to escape from their loneliness. They grow sentimental and querulous.

3645,2,A3Z40XKL5044X,B00K31DCD8,"I cannot give this a good review. I am baffled at the high amount of 5 star reviews, and can only assume they're fake. Any woman who reads this should be appalled at the way Xavier talks to/treats Lola. It is nothing short of misogynistic. He calls her a slut/whore/prostitute/easy/stupid/shallow more times that you could shake a fist at. And Lola, being an apparently dense human being, gets offended but then CONTINUES TO SEE HIM. This plot makes no sense. The characters are terrible. The writing is mediocre. The dialogue is horrendous on multiple accounts where Xavier and Sebastian speak like robots and character interactions are horribly stilted.

Also, the author makes Lola's friend look like a bimbo who only wants to sleep with hot guys just to make to make Lola look like a Princess in comparison. This whole story is infuriating, and it's even worse that almost nothing happens in the whole book and it ends on a cliffhanger.

I understand with erotica short stories it is about the sex and if one expects more they should take page length and the synopsis and reviews well into consideration before purchasing anything in this genre including this short story.  I agree with one reviewer who noted that authors do themselves a disservice and alienate potential loyal readers by dividing what clearly should be one novel into parts in order to milk a readers wallet.  That, said this was just an okay read.  I empathized with Catrina despite the lack of character development.  The writing was also just mediocre.  Nothing special.  The oral sex scenes were ""ok"" but they didn't find them particularly provocative.  I did like the premises though.  The story is told from a third person/narrative POV which worked perfectly for this type of story. Yea, I would kind of like to know how things work out for Catrina especially given the scary sadist like vibe I got from her new owner but I wasn't impressed enough to read the next installations for $2.99 each.  I won't lose any sleep over not reading them.  Once again another potential fan lost b/c of greed.  When will these self-published and/or unestablished authors learn.

3653,3,AUX37XP9G7WTV,B00K4C45PA,"This was a good summer read. I actually liked both characters and want to see what happens with the other siblings. There are a few things that could be improved. The first being an editor: object pronouns are hard to understand I guess, and commas are required in compound sentence structures. Also, there were some places with duplicated words and sentences that were rewritten but not completely corrected.

The second thing is that the heroine, while likable, just wasn't what I would call strong. She has a serious inferiority complex. She made it through her terrible childhood but couldn't come home for her dying grandmother? I don't get it at all. Her grandmother was beloved and respected all across town. The two girls were raised by their grandmother, but she believed they were ""those Maddox kids"" even after all these years.

The other thing I just didn't buy is that she didn't have a clue who the hero was. In small southern towns the younger kids know all of the older kids. Especially if they are in the same grade as a sibling. If the Southerlands are as rich, respected, well-known, etc. as the author implies, everyone in town would know everything about the kids down to their shoe size.

As I said, I enjoyed the book. I gave it a three star due to grammar problems and character development and background issues. It does have a couple of sex scenes and some language, but I've heard and seen worse on TV. The characters' thoughts are probably what make many people call this porn.

I read the book because I thought it would be a service to get my review posted. I'm just puzzled.

Whatever, on to the book.

I'd love to say it was wonderful, but alas, I can't. This story desperately needed an editor. It was riddled with errors. Not only did it have verb tense, spelling, and word usage errors (hurtle/hurdle, break/brake, forbidding/foreboding, etc.), but there were plot holes like Etta's disappearing cast. Plus there were ridiculous things like Etta sucking out snake venom at the age of 10 (um, pretty sure that's a myth no matter how old you are) and her grandfather didn't just die. Nope, he was killed by wild wolves. Etta wasn't just raped, she lost her virginity to her rapist, too. Much more tragic. Everything was just that much over the top so that it became slightly ridiculous.

Etta (Henrietta ): Orphaned, Rape victim, Love object of THREE men, Nave beyond belief,
Anson: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Sufferer, Social Anxiety Sufferer, Billionaire (inaccurate BTW, ""$17 million for several years"" doesn't equal billions)

And let me just say, unless Etta was living in a cave for her entire life, there's no way she was THIS nave:

""What's a Valentino? Is that the store it comes from?""
Anson laughed... ""It's a designer. Very nice. Very expensive. Worth more than your truck.""
""Oh! What? That's ridiculous. A dress can't be more than a car.""

And more of her supposed naivet: (or naivety as the book spells it)
""Jordan, these weren't expensive, were they?"" [when she gets a pair of Louboutins
Apparently she's never read a People magazine or seen Entertainment Tonight.

3660,3,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B00K4N02G0,"I have only been really and truly scared one time in my life, and that occurred on a hike in an isolated part of the North Georgia woods when a wild hog, tusks and all, charged straight at me (the hog was actually chasing my dog who was running back to me for safety). Fortunately for both my dog and me, the hog veered away at the last minute, but I have always had a fascination (and healthy respect) for wild hogs ever since. Naturally, I was attracted by the premise of George Mahaffey's ""Razorbacks,"" a horror thriller that, at its best, recalled my own experience but which also sometimes settled for descriptions of gore rather than genuine frights.

The main characters of ""Razorbacks"" are Avery and Peter, a father and 13-year-old son on the run from the law and a rather sticky domestic situation involving Peter's mother, a crackhead meth dealer. It would seem that leaving the mother's meth lab and sleazy boyfriend behind would have to be an improvement for Peter, but, instead, things get worse quickly. Avery and Peter are caught in a major sandstorm on a West Texas freeway and become part of a massive multi-car pileup that results from the diminished visibility. They and the handful of fellow survivors they encounter in and amongst the wreckage think that all they need to do is sit tight and ride out the storm. Instead, they soon find that there are a number of extremely large, extremely hungry hogs in the vicinity.

Razorbacks is a 100-page novella (that could easily have been made into a creenplay), so theres not a lot of room for character development here. Most of the characters, other than Avery and Peter, are merely sketched in with a single dimension, and the only time the author gets into their thought processes is usually immediately before their rather gruesome demise. For this book, however, thats not all that much of a drawback, since the emphasis is on the action and shock. To set the stage for the final confrontation between man and beast, author Mahaffey creates a good, albeit somewhat far fetched playing field. The substantial number of wrecked vehicles affords people plenty of places to hide in, under, or on top of while the pigs try to get to them. In addition, being Texas, there are a few firearms on hand, as well as some implements in some of the vehicles that the survivors transform into makeshift weapons of various sorts.

Although Razorbacks has plenty of action, the book is at its best in the early stages, before the people become aware of just whats out there, instead glimpsing things in the wind and sand. Theres a great scene in which one character allows a pet Chihuahua on a leash to go for a walk into the storm, and the predictable result still manages to be shocking. But once the battle begins in earnest, Mahaffey increasingly foregoes suspense in favor of rather graphic descriptions of gore. Apparently, these hogs have a craving for fingers, since several characters wind up getting fingers bitten off. Similar anatomical details are also described in gruesome depth.

Im no prude, and Im not opposed to graphic content in a book, but the effect of this sort of description in Razorbacks is numbing rather than shocking. After a while, the pattern of attacks, attempts at defense, and dismemberments becomes monotonous. It doesnt help matters that there seem to be a nearly endless number of attacking hogs, even though the beleaguered people manage to dispatch several of them. This repetitive action and increasing casualty list goes on far too long, so that, by the time Mahaffey gets to the final showdown, I had nearly lost interest.

Razorbacks is a book that would have worked better at 50 pages or 250 pages rather than 100. At novel length, Mahaffey could have developed more characters. Alternatively, at a shorter novelette length, he could have oridyced a really taut thriller. Instead, hes in the middle, with an interesting premise, a likable youthful protagonist in Peter, and action and suspense that go downhill fast after a solid start. When Mahaffey is on, as in the first few chapters of Razorbacks, the story is genuinely suspenseful. For that reason, I do recommend Razorbacks as an escapist horror adventure. But be aware, that, like many a prize hog, the book has a good bit of fat that could have been trimmed away.",Whole Hog,6,4/20/2017

3668,4,AQFF452SVDF48,B00K5Y8W7Y,"Marcus Winston, the Duke of Grayson, has led a very restricted life.  Diagnosed with the ""falling disease"" (epilepsy), his parents have kept him close to home his entire life.  Now that he is the Duke, his mother still tries to keep a tight rein on him.  Because he and his mother discourage visitors, he is seen as an arrogant snob.  He only has one real friend.  Miss Tamsin Tinsdale has been sent to spend  time with her cousin in the North after she caused a minor scandal in London.  It is hoped that she will learn more decorum before the start of the next Season.  Out on an early morning ride, she loses her way in the fog and ends up on the Duke's estate.  When she encounters him walking along, he is intrigued by her.  Wanting her to judge him for himself, not his title, he introduces himself as Mr Winston and incorrectly believes her to be a commoner.

I liked the Duke although I got a little irritated by him for no standing up to his mother sooner.  Tamsin was an intriguing character and I liked her independent streak.  The secondary characters were good (Jason St. Regis was a scene stealer!) and the plot was mostly good.  I would have rated the book higher had the editing been better and the weirdness of Tamsin's hand-me-down clothing bugged me.  What I enjoyed most was the sly humor that had me chuckling often.

3669,4,A1WK64OV93G9TA,B00K5Y8W7Y,"This was an entertaining Regency Romance with a great plot and interesting characters. The only problem I had with it was the editing. It seemed that a section that had been written for another part of the story had been used in the wrong spot, and a short section was repeated twice. I realize  that when writing something that is quite long the author can make changes in one spot but forget to fix those changes in a later section but it is unusual to see those inconsistencies in a published book. Other than that I really enjoyed the story.
This is the second book in ""The Regency Blooms"" series which appears to be about the Tisdale sisters. In this story Tamsin Tisdale has done something scandalous while in her first London season and as punishment has been sent to visit her cousin at her uncle's home somewhere in the far north of England. Her mother told her she is to think about her impulsiveness and unladylike behavior and hopefully learn to restrain her behavior and tongue.
One foggy morning she impulsively takes off riding alone and gets lost. The local Duke has also fled his house to get away from his feelings of being locked away in his own home. Apparently he has some physical malady that the family has gone to great lengths to keep secret to the point that he rarely leaves the house, and is constantly reminded to be careful of his health by his overprotective mother. As the fog starts to lift he is surprised to see a rider coming towards him, trespassing on his property which is strictly forbidden. The rider turns out to be not a man as he thought, but Miss Tisdale who does not know where she is or how to get back to her uncle's house. She is very bold in addressing him, not following proper social behavior, demanding to know who he is and if he can tell her how to get home. The Duke is so shocked at her behavior but also attracted to her openness,  that he immediately starts to develop feelings for her. She has said some unflattering things about the local Duke, his reclusiveness and the harsh trespassing rules he has set, and she fears accidentally riding on his land; so the Duke is afraid to tell her who he really is and says he is Mr. Winston, the cousin of the Duke.
Their attraction grows as does the problems they encounter. The Duchess does not want to give up her control of her son, she has already chosen the perfect bride for him, his best friend is falling in love with Timsin as well, Timsin doesn't want to marry anyone, but she loves Mr. Winston,,, How will this all turn out? Fortunately it is all in the book and more.

3673,3,A1F1XYMX769KWE,B00K6N75LS,"It was an entertaining read that went by all too fast. I enjoyed Daisy's voice, and the novel evoked the depths of a Minnesota winter all too accurately!

The mystery was OK, as were most of the characters. For some reason, neither really gelled for me, and I think for similar reasons- being vague around the edges, and obviously more driven by the plot than by their own characters. And the mystery- well, I called it pretty early, but then I read a lot.

There's a lot about Daisy's daily life here, and some of it made me wonder. She is parenting 4 kids, and homeschooling the youngest 3-  2 in second and third grade, and the other 10 or so. And yet, she feels comfortable leaving them alone for hours while she does other stuff- errands and sleuthing? The 10-year-old is mostly enmeshed in computer games, so it's not like he's babysitting his sisters, and they are far too young to be left unsupervised for more then a few minutes, I think.  From accounts in the book, it is questionable whether the 10-year-old ought to be left unsupervised for long... Also, it's obviously written by a home-schooling advocate, but the book seems to describe unschooling more than homeschooling. This is convenient for Daisy as she sleuths, but maybe not a great description of homeschooling.

The focus goes back and forth between the two main characters of Cacy and Eli, and I saw some other reviews that complained about the length of the sex scenes, but there's only two and a half really. Their length seemed pretty typical of what you'd find in a romance novel. I don't mind some good sex scenes, just be warned that they are there and pretty descriptive. I was more interested in the world, and it was a little annoying with all the lead up to the characters actually getting together. I was getting a little tired of each character's perspective on the other, the constant ""oh I really want this person like crazy, but I can't get involved with them, but I still want them like crazy,"" was getting old.

For one the pacing I was 100 pages in and still you don't really know what going on. Most of the pack was very abrasive and very unlikeable. And its frustrating that sky is so recluse and helpless through the whole book hello your a werewolf. Which I feel that she doesn't really explore. She doesn't seem to have wolf instincts or trouble controlling her instincts. Honestly it feels like she is angsting for no reason.  Some got frustrated with her panic or distrust of the pack but I got it I wouldn't trust them either half wanted to kill her the other half were really dangerous and animal. I did like the pack leader Ethan was a jerk through most of the story and josh seems more dangerous with his lust for magic. I love this genra and it has potential both the character are so dislikable...one part at the end got me this is a little spoilery but josh does something tricky to sky at then end that to me feels like a betrayal but that sky doesn't even get mad at.

3687,3,AMLBH94TSEHW2,B00K9W0F9A,"When I read the first book in a new series, Im primarily looking for one thing: does this book make me want to read the next one? In the case of Moon Tortured, I would have to say that it did; however, the journey to that point was a rough one. This urban fantasy includes the familiar players in the genre: werewolves/were-animals, vampires, warlocks, and mentions of the fae, elves, etc. Definitely in the paranormal world here.

Skylar Brooks is a werewolf and something else that becomes the central point of the story. She doesnt know what she is and neither does anyone else. And that little extra bit has put her in the protection of a were-animal pack.

I struggled with the first 20% of the book. Between the blatant character description dumps and lack of world information I felt like I was too immersed. It was clear we were in an alternate modern world but the descriptions focused on the characters and less-so on everything around them. As the story progressed, the protagonist, Skylar, was left in the dark by the rest of the cast because she couldn't know what was going on. While this partially fit the story, it also seemed to become and excuse for her to be ignorant of the situation and create a sense of mystery. Instead of hooking me, I became annoyed as it continued like this for quite some time.

Despite the beginning third of the book, I eventually got into the story. I really wasn't a fan of Skylar and her reckless decisions that kept putting her in danger. In fact, of the entire cast, I think my favorite character was Winter. Part of the Midwest Pack protecting her, Winter had the least amount of backstory given (except maybe Gavin) yet they both became two of my favorite characters in the book. She wasn't helpless and her attitude toward Skylar held a lot of sense. Gavin is just interesting because he comes out of nowhere and you don't know anything about him (which is at odds with this book because you're given info on most of the characters). That made him stand out against the rest.

I also wasn't a big fan of Ethan, one of the other main players. You can see how this can be a problem when I care more about side characters than protagonists. He held a constant animosity toward Skylar that went from being alright to just annoying when there was really no cause. Ethan became one-dimensional with anger and irritation as his calling cards. His brother, Josh, had more going for him with a lust for magic and a personality that was all over the place. Not sure how I feel about him, to be honest.

This book is almost entirely character-driven, circling around the decisions they make and the consequences that come from them. As someone who prefers a decent amount of world-building along with character development, this book wasn't entirely suited to my personal reading tastes. Overall, I wouldnt consider this a standout book in the genre but I enjoyed it by the end. While Im not desperately grabbing for the sequel, I would certainly read it and may do so in the future. Moon Tortured holds potential as a series but I would consider this an average starter perfect for fans looking for a new urban fantasy series.",Average Series Starter for Urban Fantasy Fans,26,8/9/2016
3688,4,A1JL0D4KG4GZ1N,B00K9W0F9A,"I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I bought this book. I enjoy a good paranormal book and thought like this sounded like an interesting book.

The story revolves around Sky who we are introduced to and find that she a young, peaceful woman, struggling with her identity, and trying to enjoy life with her adopted mother.

An attack with tragic consequences sends Skylar into the wolf's den, literary. A place that she doesn't want to be and surrounded by something that she has spent her entire life hiding from.

Skylar, rightly so, is scared and trying to figure out why she is surrounded by these extremely violent people whom she just watched brutally kill people. She doesn't trust them and wonders if she will be the next casualty. They say she's not a prisoner but yet she cannot leave, well she can but when she does bad things happen.

Through time she understands that while they really are protecting her she still wonders why. They are not willing to share details and some of it they do not even know.

In steps the magic wielder that seemingly holds the keys to information and her safety. Together, along with her minders, they embark on a journey to discover why Skylar is marked for death by the entire paranormal community and being hunted by a powerful Vampire in search of the ultimate gift.

There were many times I was annoyed with Skylar as she seems to spend most of the book stuck in the same mental loop even when evidence clearly point to the opposite. She has a strong moral compass and holds onto it with a death grip through the carnage that seems to follow her like a shadow.

I really kept waiting for her to come into her own and there were sparks occasionally only to see her basically regress back at the end, although she does grow in some respects. I guess we will need to read the rest of the series to she where life takes Skylar.

I enjoyed the book and if you're a fan of paranormal books then I think you'll enjoy this book and series.","Shoved into a life she'd been trying to hide from, surrounded by brutal killers. What could go wrong?",7,7/18/2016

Ever since the love of her life, Chase Malone left home ten long years ago  never once looking back to pursue his musical career, Krista took it upon herself to check up on his mother every chance she got and today  there was a crucial emergency causing her to notify Chase for the first time in a decade.  Rock Star, Chase Malone was not only lonely but his heart was drifting back to Harper's Crossing, Illinois, his  hometown where he was from and the one girl that lived there who had captured his heart and soul so long ago.  Krista!  Whenever he felt melancholy, he would play ""Crazy Love"", the song that he wrote for them and the song that became a success overnight.  For ten long years, Chase tried to communicate with her but he never heard a word from that spitfire,  the no-nonsense redhead that she was known for, that is,  until today.  His mother had taken a stroke according to Krista's messages and he was finally going home.  As Krista sat quietly in Abby's room she was stunned by the figure who just entered the hospital room.  Chase!  She hoped and prayed that she was over him once and for all but she was sadly mistaken as the old flames bursted to the surface causing her to become angry at every question he asked her.  As Krista bolted from the room, she knew that he could break her heart all over again if he chose to do so just like he did ten years ago.  Chase couldn't believe that the girl he left behind was now a beautiful woman but he could also tell that she was still angry with him for leaving town.  As Krista drove to Abby's to return her dog, she knew instantly that Chase was staying there but as she was leaving to go,it didn't help matters when she accidentally bumped into a very bare and extremely sexy chest.  Chase!  Krista never had a problem being angry with him in the past and either did he, especially after when they ended up in bed kissing each other passionately,and making love all hours of the night,  but for some reason the boy she once knew was now a hot and sexy man and she was totally tongue-tied.  Chase knew that he wanted the woman that he loved and thought of staying in Harper's  Crossing for good and the thought excited him even more,as he was determined to win her back at all costs.  With his own demons and insecurities buried deep inside, he had no other choice back then, but to leave and  his biggest regret was leaving the one girl that he never stopped loving.  As Krista was leaving Abby's house, the electricity between her and Chase never left and it was still there between them just like all those years ago.  Chase saw the spitfire in her that he was so familiar with, and in that moment, he knew what he had to do.  Continue to bait and goad her if he ever expected to win her back just like he did back their high school days when he instigated sparring fits with her.  After falling into Chase's trap, Krista asked him to sing at the festival  and he only agreed if she would have dinner with him and when she agreed they eventually found themselves entangled in in a passionate love affair.  For a week of spending more and more time together, Krista knew it was only a matter of time Chase would leave town again. Having no choice but to leave town temporarily due to a promise  and obligation he made pertaining to his career, Chase made up his mind right then there that this would be the last time he ever left Krista again,but when  Krista sees him on the Internet with a high class model, her heart is broken even more for the second time in her life.

While it is touted as a prequel of sorts to his novel The City, you need not have read it  I haven't  to enjoy this mesmerizing and tender short story. Koontz immediately sucks us into the world of gangly 12 year old Malcolm and his beautiful 17 year old sister, Amalia, whom he adores. Their parents are terrible and Malcolm describes their house as being like Poes House of Usher just before it sank into the swamp. Music is an escape for them, Malcolm finding the one thing he is graceful at in the Saxophone, while his very talented sister plays the clarinet and wants to be a writer. They also share a love for Big Band music of the 1930s and 1940s, which they play on vinyl records in the garage to avoid parents who hardly speak to one another. If this already seems like a lot to include in a short story, it is little touches like these which separate Koontz from the pack.

At the center of the story is the house next door, once belonging to recently deceased teacher Rupert Clockenwell. Someone is turning on lights at night in the old house, and Malcolm and his sister Amalia decide to pay the new neighbors a visit. Except there are no new neighbors, only sad revelations, and great danger. To reveal more would ruin this touching and enthralling short story I truly loved. In addition to being an amazing read, it reminded me why I so often prefer Koontz to King. Though the novels of both have become bloated as of late, they both excel  when they want to  at the short form. But Koontzs attitude in regard to the human spirit, and the spiritual in general, sets him apart.

I don't know what Hayes is like in real life - could be as funny as his writing, or some snarly curmudgeon, but in truth he is one of the best writers I have come across.  His characters are actually believable, something that is difficult to do when writing of half orcs and the like, that you can really identify with.  And at times laugh at or with.

If you like role playing games,  you will doubtless like this book and find it extremly amusing.  But even if your not into RPG's (Like myself) you will be caught up in the story and before long may start to wonder what your missing by NOT playing RPG's...  So read this.  In fact, read all of his books and stories.  They are truly excellent and fun to read - I like them so much I am on the list to be notified when something new is released.

There is suspense, many twists which surprised me, no cliffhanger, a very bumpy road to HEA, but we do get HEA.  Passionate lovemaking, that was maybe above mild, but not erotic.

3703,4,A2S67VSBU2C281,B00KBAYOTM,"No spoiler with this review: THE BRIDE GIFT is a romantic and suspenseful tale of the High Middle Ages, set North of England, with the story opening during the Spring of 1153. Helena of Lystanwold, who had been under the guardianship of her uncle, is informed that she has been married by proxy to a warrior named Guy of Helston (the ""Scourge of Faringdon""). Her uncle, having been banished by King Stephen, had arranged the marriage to protect her during his absence. Of particular concern is Ranulf of Dartmoore, a malevolent man who wants to acquire Lystanwold and the earldom by any means necessary.  He is known to have been responsible for the death of Helena's sister. Helena initially fears the marriage bed with Sir Guy, whom she perceives to be a controlling and hardened warrior who can not be trusted. Guy, a man of few words, takes his new responsibilities seriously, but has limited ability to communicate effectively with Helena and others at Lystanwold. The miscommunication and Helena's inability to accept Guy's authority results in much of the initial angst of the story. As might be expected during this time period, there is mayhem, murder, sword-play, and kidnapping, in addition to the romance.  The interesting characters include a former mistress who arrives pregnant and indicating that Guy is possibly the father, a cousin who at times is seemingly supportive of Helena but at times indicates that he might just be self-serving, the knowing Bridget-who serves Helena, Sir Guy's young and clumsy squire Geoffrey, the faithful retainer, other knights, King Stephen, and as would be expected, additional characters.

The story is well-constructed, gives a sense of the history of the time period, and overall has realistic dialogue. Helena is thought by some to be feisty, but exhibits behavior that at times seems thoughtless, dangerously impulsive, and almost childlike, which makes her less believable for the time period, especially given her age. The sexual situations are well-written, fit in seamlessly, and are not overly descriptive. There are a couple of violent events which are described in detail and which might disturb some readers. This historical romance moves at a relatively quick pace and is easy to read to conclusion.  I found it to be enjoyable overall, and am pleased to find, in Sarah Hegger, another skilled author who writes in this genre.",A well-written and fast-paced romance of the High Middle Ages,3,12/30/2016

The female protagonist of this early medieval piece is Helena, a 22 year woman who is willfully and ridiculously head strong and hot tempered.  So much so in fact that she endangers herself and others multiple times in the 72% of the novel that I read before I got disgusted and quit.

The aggravating part is that she knows this about herself but continues to act childishly throughout the novel. It's not that she doesn't have some legitimate complaints , it's that she acts so foolishly and recklessly that it's highly unlikely she ever exact the revenge for her sister's death.  I also understood her anger at being married off against her will, but after finally accepting Sir Guy, her husband, she continued to act the shrew.

At first, I did not like that, but I got to understand her better as the story progressed. Oh, and I absolutely LOVED guy. He does not say much and that frustrates Nell. He had an abusive father and is protective of those he cares about. I don't think the sex scenes were too explicit. I usually skim over those pages, because I also do not like that.

3710,5,A3N4LWILIPVBIK,B00KBB4PYK,"I ran across this series on a blog that I follow.  I cant remember who the blogger was, but she had a really good review about these books.  At that time, book 17 hadnt been published.  The review intrigued me, and I wanted to give them a try.  The first 4 books came as a box-set, so I went ahead and bought it.  Now, Im hooked.  This is definitely one of my guilty pleasure series, and I will be reading the rest, one-by-one.  You can buy the whole set, but thats a lot of money to fork out all at once.

Claimed introduces us to the Kindred Warriors, who they are, and why the are mostly a male species.  The only way they can repopulate is by claiming females of the different worlds they contract with.  Olivia happens to be one such female, and she fights the bonding tooth and nail.  She doesnt want to leave her new career  and twin sister, Sophia.

The Kindred Warriors are huge, powerful males.  There are three types: Beast Kindred, Blood Kindred, and Twin Kindred.  Each type has their own mating/bonding rituals. They are very sexual animals, but they also worship and protect the females they bond for life with.

Baird is a Beast Kindred, and as he tries explaining to Olivia whats involved in the bonding ritual, she wants no part of it.  The breeding organ of a Beast Kindred can be overwhelming for a small, human female.  Kindred Warriors also love talking dirty, and aren't afraid of telling you what they're going to do to you.  That part gets a little repetitive, but thats their nature, so I can forgive them.

The story is very well-written with the fighting back and forth between Olivia and Baird, as she tries resisting his mating scent and the bonding.  The characters are well-established and I couldn't help but fall in love with both of them, hoping they would finally find each other.

My favorite part of this book was when Olivia went to visit a friend who was mated to Twin Kindreds and she ended up in the unmated area of the ship.  Baird hadnt been able to scent mark her yet, so she was open prey to any unmated male that wanted to claim her.

Hunted is the story of Olivias twin sister, Sophia and Bairds brother, Sylvan.  The attraction between these two started in the first book, but they fought it as Sylvan was dealing with a previous failed bonding, and had sworn to never claim another bride, and Sophia had a fear of needles and vampires.  See, for a Blood Kindred to bond, and implant their seed, they need to bite you.  I would have to agree with Sophias take on this.  I hate needles myself.  YUCK!

This book goes into more detail about the AllFather and the Scourge and why they are mortal enemies of the Kindred.  The AllFather had a prophecy about a girl with a mark on her chest, and he thinks that girl is Sophia.  She could be the restart of their race, by breeding with her and siring new offspring.  Unfortunately, there aren't that many true Scourges left.  I think its only the AllFather and his son.

While running from the AllFather, Sophia and Sylvan crash land in a remote area on Earth.  There, they must hide from the AllFathers beasts, and the only way to do that is by marking Sophia with his scent.  Theres a lot more sexual tension between these two than there was between Baird ad Olivia.

Sophia is the weaker of the twins, but she rises to the challenge.  I think I like her character better than Olivias.  One thing I noticed, her name was spelled several ways, Sophia or Sophie.  Im not sure if that was the Kindred way of saying her name or not.  My favorite scene is the book was while they were in the cabin.  It was pretty hot.

Out of the four books Ive read so far, Sought is my second favorite.  I really identified with Kat as Im also a curvy, plus-sized gal, and I would love having two studs lusting over me.

Kat, Deep, and Lock were introduced in the second book.  See how the author does that.  Each story gets more detailed with characters, and world building.  The story line behind these books is plotted very well.  It just keeps you wanting to read the next one to see what happens with the new characters that the previous book ends with.

This was a longer book, as the characters had to travel over several different planets, looking for the cure to save Kat.  I loved the light and dark twins of Lock and Deep.  I favored Deep the most. I felt their anguish as they tried reconciling their differences with themselves and Kat.  Out of the three different mating bonds of the Kindred Warriors, this is the one I would opt for.  I would love having two males fawning over me.  Sigh.

As with each book, the animosity between the characters drive the story forward, as well as the sexual tension.  The Twin Kindred requires the mating of both brothers at the same time with their female.  Pretty kinky, and hot.  The best scenes were when Lock, Deep, and Kat mind-melded to search for Sophia and then Lauren.  But this also caused their problems.

Found is my favorite of the four books.  I felt very deeply for Xairn in the last book, and I couldn't wait to see how he overcame his father, and the rising brutal lust that was part of his DNA.  Im not into BDSM, so that part of the book didn't really do much for me, but it was all the evil and horror he endured at the AllFathers hands that endeared him to me.  And Lauren was a great buffer to his hurt soul, though she also suffered at the AllFathers hands.

We travel off world with this book too, and once again are introduced too a wide range of alien life forms and ideals.  Trying to escape his father, Xairn takes them to a planet where they can change their DNA signature.  I agree with Lauren, I preferred Xairn when he looked like a Scourge instead of a human.  Thats what made him unique.

Once they got back to Earth, I thought the pace slowed down too much.  The see-sawing back and forth between should Xairn relent to his feelings, or should he keep trying to hold himself under control was a bit much.

I do have to say, each book couldve done with a bit of polishing in the proofreading department.

If you love hot, steamy books, with a terrific science-fiction, paranormal storyline, you have to read this series.  I give the box-set 5 feathers",TERRIFIC SERIES.  I'M HOOKED,3,4/28/2016
3711,5,A2JIMB6ATUBH7U,B00KBN0F3S,"I liked the initial story. The librarian (sexy of course), gets left by the ex-fianc a few weeks before the wedding when he tells her he does not want kids and never intends to have them. since kids are a BIG priority for her, this is definitely a deal breaker. A year later her good friends set her up on a blind date with an absolutely gorgeous guy, smart, funny, wealthy, etc. There is instant chemistry and she decides to throw caution to the wind and go home and have a wild night of sex with him. Can't say I blamed her!! This guy was way off the OMG charts. I didn't come across any wild sex scenes. They just said after the fact that it was a wild night of sex. So, that should offend anyone. They seem to both think that this could really go somewhere. SPOILER - now, just an opinion from this point. I really like this guy but he does have issues and since the sex is so good between the two he is very interested in keeping things going. Some would call it a booty call. However, she is getting as much out of it as he is, sex wise, and in the back of her head she has marriage and kids plans. Until he tells her that he doesn't want to have kids or get married. Instant end to the booty calls. But back on again for various reasons, off again and on again. Then her buttinski best friends decide they are going to bring him up to scratch by limiting her booty calls. did I mention these people are all approaching 30 -not 13. Best friends like these I could do without. I dislike it in real life and hate it in fiction when everybody in the story knows what is best for you and sets out to achieve their own agenda. RARELY are these same people in control of their own life!! Case in point, one of the best friends is pregnant and the wedding is down the road. Not a big deal in today's world but still... are they really qualified to tell you how to run your own sex life? Now, the guy has already said he is against marriage and kids so they are going to change his mind. Does this every really work out? I would imagine he is going to ""see the light"" and suddenly become the best husband on the planet and the father of the year but I got tired of all the back and forth and everyone interfering. I quit reading. I just got to the point where I didn't really care what happened with these two. I liked him and he seemed to have a good head on his shoulders, etc. I liked her but she allowed too many well meaning people to interfere with her life plans. For example, the ex-fianc shows up after his promotion and move after he dumped her didn't work out. He has had a change of heart and he wants her back. She lets him help in the garden and after all, they could be friends (really?)? and then goes to dinner and a movie with him . Now this is the guy that broke her heart and had her in tears for a year and just like that she is over it and willing to be his friend. Nah, don't see that happening. I found her in too many situations where she didn't want to be there but allow someone to push her into it and she allowed it to happen. Like the too short dress Emily pusher on her at the bachelorette party. She felt like a hooker but she wore it anyway. I'm sure a lot will find the book very entertaining and there is nothing wrong with the story. There were just personalities, etc. that rubbed me the wrong way and I got tired of reading about them. So, even though this was not one of my favorites no reason why it can't be yours. This was a very enjoyable romance story with lots of love and a really good storyline. I enjoyed how the author developed the romance story between the two main characters and also how she incorporated the secondary characters into the story.

3719,3,A1H0YQBSH2G00Z,B00KC1DLF8,"Gobekli Tepe is a 12,000 year old megalithic complex in Turkey, between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and near the plain of Mush. It contains some of the oldest stone architecture in the world, with rings of T-shaped monoliths weighing 10-15 tons. The site challenges archeologists because its sophisticated architecture precedes the rise of ancient great civilizations such as Sumer, Babylon, and Egypt.

Andrew Collins proposes in this heavily documented book that Gobekli Tepe was built at the end of the last ice age as a reaction to a global cataclysm, perhaps the Biblical Great Flood, to serve ritual purposes of averting future disasters. The builders, he hypothesizes, were the Watchers of the Book of Enoch; actually an advanced Swiderian culture migrating south from regions now in Russia. They possessed knowledge of astronomy, metal working, agriculture, pottery, etc. that impressed local Anatolian residents, who saw them as demigods. Collins connects archeological facts with Biblical accounts of the Garden of Eden and fallen angels; the Watchers broke laws of heaven by descending among mortals, taking women and having offspring, the giant Nephilim, thus getting the Adamic line thrown out of the Garden.

A thought provoking book, it lags due to repetition and crossover facts. Better organized presentation and tightening of details would make it more readable.","Ancient cities, the Biblical Watchers, and searching for Eden",2,3/9/2017

I would listen to one and nod my head with a smile. Then the next would resonate too! Some of the stories are tongue-in-cheek and some are laugh out loud delightful. The stories deal with family, friends, people at work and strangers.

The novel could be described as a somewhat-oxymoronic relaxing adventure. Though the stakes are high for the guys involved, and theres plenty of action, its really a fun and quick read  the kind of book you take on vacation. Or better yet: its the kind of book that feels like going on vacation.
Given that author Colenbrander has led a fairly adventurous life of his own, he lends a fair bit of credibility and realism to this tale, so it seems less like an adventurous fantasy, and more like something that could happen. However, he does veer to the fantastical in some respects (all the adventurers are uncommonly handsome, for one), but in an adventure story, thats sometimes the order of the day.
If you want an escape, complete with local color about the Congo, and even some tender moments among friends, then The Power of Seventy is an entertaining choice. You might not want to get into the predicaments they do, but youll be glad to sit back and enjoy the ride.",Sit back and enjoy the ride!,2,1/5/2017

I really liked Charles but could not figure out what on earth he saw in Martha.  Their story was extremely tedious and boring, mainly because of Martha.  She was arrogant, mean-spirited and unpleasant toward Charles.

I loved Alfred from the previous book and felt he very much deserved his own love story.  Then much to my surprise, I found Laura to be very endearing and loveable.  Of the two couples, Alfred and Laura seemed to have such potential for true happiness which they both richly deserved.  I was stunned and angry when the author had Laura murdered!  Why kill off one of the best characters in the book?  The irony of it is that the whole storyline went flat after that.  The epilogue was a joke ... really? ... Alfred and Laura did not get the story they deserved.

This Matchmaker Mystery Novella is the first book in its series. It is a cute, rather quick read. It is a rather light story, nothing heavy and fast paced. Tom (a private investigator) and Jane (a professional pet sitter and Tom's prime suspect in a string of residential robberies) are brought together by the mysterious, enigmatic Armani (a psychic matchmaker). The story also features Tom's Aunt Ruby, his best friend, Brady, and Jane's best friend, Alyssa. The characters in the book all have their own distinct personality. Calamity, Jane's foster dog, does play a role in the story, but not nearly as much of one as the pets in the previous 4 books in the anthology.

However, as I started to read, I found I did not like the descriptive terms the author used to call the intimate parts of the body.

Because she was able to get to the 2 men that did this horrific thing and dominate them, and then leave them.

There is just a two week advancement of time from book 2 & 3. I was glad there wasn't a huge jump forward in time. Between Arianna's gain of power and the losses she suffered.

Paranormal mysteries are something I gravitate towards. In this series one of the biggest mysteries is Desmond who we know little about, aside from his protection of Arianna. We get to know much more about him.

It actually would have been sooner, but many medications had to be Weaned off of.  I know it's hard to believe that anyone could be on 27 medications a day, but I've seen people on a lot more.  If people don't think what you eat matters, It DOES.  When I went Gluten Free, it Helped Some of my Allergies, my Breathing, (I still have Asthma & COPD), I went off All Narcotic Pain Meds I'd Been on for Years, I went off Celebrex Arthritis Medication, I went off Neurontin ((Extremely High Doses) & I was able to stop using Nebulizers & all but 1 Recue Inhaler.  It made a HUGE DIFFERENCE.  Why hadn't I gone Gluten Free years Earlier/  Because during my Annual Allergy Tests, I was Tested for WHEAT ALLERGY & tested NEGATIVE multiple times.  I was NEVER tested for Celiac Disease, even though my Grandmother & one Aunt had it.  I later learned that because wheat has been MODIFIED, it contains TWENTY SEVEN ALLERGENS IN IT and the Allergy Skin Prick Tests Only Tests You For THREE of Those Allergens.  Seems like that's something they would tell you.  So, even when you test Negative for the Allergy, you can Still be Allergic to Wheat.

3761,5,AMJ0DPLMVBDKS,B00KFYIEN6,"The book focuses on clean eating, avoiding processed foods, the benefits of it and recipes for doing so.  Im all about clean eating, so I decided to give the book a shot and see if the recipes appealed. There is a fairly wide range of recipes, all with ingredients on the outer edge of the grocery store :) (yeah natural!).  But the recipes aren't natural-nazi (you know the Seinfeld Soup Nazi? NO SOUP FOR YOU! ).  This author isn't like that with totally 100% natural, which is a huge relief.  Its nice to see some recipes call for a can of corn.  I know fresh corn is better than canned corn, but sometimes the time of year or tightness of ones pocketbook makes the can look a whole lot more appealing.

The book does give interesting keys to what supposedly shrinks belly fat, which I had never heard of before. I hate to reveal what the book calls a secret in the review, but it has to do with certain food choices that are important for eliminating belly fat.

As for the read, the author also uses fun non-formal language like blast away belly fat which I found to make reading it easy and fun.

Some recipes I really like.  My favorites include Hummus Dip, Vegetables Fritita, Authentic Pico De Gallo, Guacamole, Lemon Garlic Broccoli, Cod and Salsa, Mexican Chicken, Orange Lime Shrimp and Tangy Salad. (There is a pic of the tangy salad I made - yum!) I admit I steered clear of the carb-centered recipes however.

I have to admit I tried the recipes, but I did not follow the diet so to speak (and cant speak to whether it melts belly fat). Everyones goal is different and mine is healthy eating and weight maintenance rather than weight loss.  But in addition to the recipes the book gives some concise tips geared toward helping people make better choices in general.  There were good tips I already incorporate in my lifestyle and also ones that I hadn't  so I found it to give me some good tips to better my daily choices.

This one is, to be honest, the worst of the three.  Between childish language (""if you mess with your immune system"") and tautological reasoning, which is using your argument to support your argument (""By strengthening the immune system with the proper nutrition from the foods you eat you can strengthen the immune system so it can fight off infections and horrible health conditions""), I can't take this seriously.

The authors appear to be trying to provide nutritional advice with information gleaned from a fifth grader's science fair project.  They call calorie counting a lie with no actual support, provide no discussion on the actual necessity for calories, fats, etc.

The book presents ways to change dietary habits to be healthy and lose weight.  The book has two sections, Low Carb and Comfort Food, and while I focused on the Low-Carb section, both were good.  It actually has a table of contents (often recipes books dont) which makes it so much easier to read and use!

CONTENTS:I learned some really interesting things in this book.  The author brings across points in an easy-to-understand way. Example: We unintentionally eat more sugar than we should.  The author brought that point across by saying woman can have a max of 6 tsp of sugar in a day (a man 9 tsp), and guess what? A bowl of whole grain cereal can contain as much as 9 teaspoons.  That example Ive never heard before and it brought home the point really well in a tangible way.  Also, its well thought-out in its presentation of recipes. There is not only breakfast, lunch and dinner categories, but sides, make-ahead snacks, desserts, drinks, etc.

MY FAVORITES: Low Cal Greek Salad was pretty wonderful. I didn't notice a difference using low-fat feta and the recipe used a great variety of veggies plus and simple spices to make a SUPER low-cal (and tasty!) salad.  The Sassy Cheese & Chicken Enchiladas were wonderful and the name itself made it fun to make (who doesnt love introducing a dish with a fun name like that?) Finally, I loved the Colorful Veggie Meatloaf.  It was great, plus it gave me some new ideas of interesting veggie additions to meatloaf.

I am always critical of any type of ""diet"" book because a lot of the claims have no proof behind them and many of these diets can actually be damaging in the long run.  Since I am trying to eat healthier overall and not just diet to lose a couple of pounds I am pretty critical of these ""fad"" diets.  The smoothie diet in particular has a lot of potential health risks which the authors do not bother to cover so I will fill them in.  Simply searching out more information provides numerous potential risks which I want to list for the benefit of someone who might be thinking about trying out the diet.

First, it is really difficult to get all of the needed nutrients through a liquid diet and since the authors provide no references or offer credibility I wouldn't trust their assumptions at face value.

Second, sugar spikes, cravings, and rebound weight gain are really common with liquid based diets.

Third, without proper nutrition and with liquid predominate diets you are more susceptible to digestive issues, gallstones, and muscle loss which are all likely to cause problems down the road.

Many of the healthy eating books I have read recommend only replacing one meal a day with a smoothie.

I do like that there are a lot of recipes for smoothies and I will try out a few of them but switching the majority of your calories to just smoothies is not something I would do.

The information on the eating clean diet is word for word the same as it is in several other books I have looked at.  There really isn't enough information provided to have a sustainable diet beyond the 5 day meal plan that is provided.  I'm not sure why so many books insist on throwing in a second diet just to bulk up how many pages are in the book when there is so much more useful information that could have been added to the smoothie section.",Lots of smoothie recipes but skips all the potential risks of the diet,2,5/6/2016

3766,2,A2N0TLGV1JG5R4,B00KFZCAAI,"The title intrigued me, and the cover also drew me in, so I was willing to give it a chance.  Nina, was the one who always took care of herself and her younger sister. They come from a broken home, you know the story. However, she was working as a real estate agent, who was doing well for herself. She was supporting not only herself and her husband, but she was also able to pay for her sisters house as well. Helping her keep a float after divorce number 2. Early on Nina finds out her husband has a gambling problem and has gambled away everything Nina had worked her whole life for six figures worth.  And she finally decides that enough is enough, and she decides that she is going to leave him. She had everything packed and ready to go, and has it loaded in her car. Nin gets up early to sneak away as to not face her soon to be ex-husband.

Nina is getting ready to leave and he comes out to see her off, which surprises her because she thinks he is still asleep. They end up having sex right there in their carport before she leaves. Her ex-husband still promising to change and get help and to pay off the debit. She leaves and never looks back.  A little odd that she even did that knowing she was leaving for good, that just didn't seem right to me.

She moves in with her sister, till she gets on her feet. Not to long after moving in with her sister she ends up showing a house to a really rich, woman, who only uses the real estate company and this time Nina was lucky enough to get to show her the house.

Not only does this women, whose name is Petra, buy the house, she offers Nina a job, basically to be a glorified escort. Making 6 figures a year and she would sleep with these rich men. This is where the book kind of loses me. She ends up taking the job after she gets fired from her real estate agency. And she takes it to A. Take care of her sister and her sisters kids, and B to get herself out of debt. But we don't meet the guy she is Owned by until the end of the book, and since this is a series, and even then it does seem kind of rushed.  The Billionaire reminded me more of Bill gates than the guy on the cover. To me I pictured a geeky nerd (Not that it isn't hot, just not the guy I wouldve pictured to be put on the cover.)  He ends up giving her a phone, that he can text her on, it only has his number and that way he can get to know her more. They say in the book he is pretty much like a 17 year when it comes to dating.  So he is awkward and such when it comes to women.

After about 24 hours of texting the next time they meet he isn't so awkward, which was something that I also found didn't add up.  But he offers her a week with him on a train because he hates to fly.  So he tells her to come to the train, in only a coat and some thigh highs tights and heels. He is taking her to his high school reunion, and they are going to be on a train for a week. Really just way too fast for how everything fell into place. Im all for quick, but I guess because of the way the whole story was this didn't seem like something that would really happen.

I read this book because it was free, but I wouldnt even really call it a book, its more of a Novella, and the next book it the series is way over priced for only be 144 pages long. Needless to say I did not finish the series. Im not likely to read anything else by this author.

They look like humans but can jump straight up to land on the roof of a 20 or 30 story building and then jump back down with no harm. Their stronger then any human and if they ""Falling"" in love for another creatus or human it is forever.
The individual 5 stories involve Creatus of the Ashton family, humans, police, the FBI and the NSC. Creatus work in all kinds of human employment but try to keep their special abilities to themselves. Unfortunately not all Creatus like humans some have out right hatred for them. That is theme of the 5 stories as which are well written, page turning, action packed with murders, attempted suicide, match making, falling in love, deception, mistrusting within families, honesty and faithfulness.

3774,5,A4W19SPNTZ01C,B00KGK9A5A,"I usually don't read a series a book after the other because the author might feel the need to explain everything again and again. I didn't get this feeling with this series. Ok, now that this is out of the way, let's go on with the story.

Creatus's love is stronger than human's. Once they fall for another, it's for life and they will slowly die if their mate dies. Each book follows a new couple that will fall or might have fallen for each other already. However, each also gets the readers deeper into the main story: Creatus rogues who want the world to know about them. Who's behind it and exactly why? I thought it was well built for the final show down.

Couples: It's always easy to figure out who would be the next couple. I'm not sure if it was a good thing or not since it made some things a bit predictable. I won't name them so as not to spoil anything, which is hard since I won't be able to name my favorite couple. All I will say is that it's the couple following Derrick's, so not the prequel nor the first book, which are about him but the second book. To be honest, Kristina grows on the readers but she starts as a not so likeable brat. Still I hate that while we still see her in the other books she's kind of pushed out of the story.

Story: I love that it has aliens. I am an alien fan, all that relates to aliens. So, Creatus are aliens who came to Earth a long time ago. They hid among humans. Live their life as humans as much as they could. They are stronger and faster and have longer lifespan than Earthlings, so stories have sprouted from people catching a glimpse at them doing extraordinary stuff: Folklore such as vampires, or superheroes and the likes came to life from it. The idea was plausible, interesting, and well done.

I would recommend to fans of aliens and vampires. But be aware that while these Creatus are aliens, I would call this urban fantasy more than science fiction.","Aliens with a vampire lore, what's not to love?",2,12/29/2016

3777,5,ADDCC3KEKSCL9,B00KGK9A5A,"A new twist on an old tale. Creatus have been inhabiting the earth longer than man and came from another planet. Similar to humans in appearance, but also showing likenesses to the mythological vampires, they can jump building in one leap, are stronger than humans, and live much longer lives, giving the immortal tales an origin.

Some things about creatus that are interesting- they cannot eat cooked foods- which can actually makes them deathly ill or even kill them. They have both good and bad members- they have lived in secret, alongside humans for centuries- they also started the superhero rumors back when they 'watched' the humans and protected them against their own species who were evil. They also have a physical-almost chemical- reaction when they meet their life mate, or soul mate- called 'falling' and once a creatus falls, it is for life- they cannot live without their mates and will die for them or die without them.

This series was packed from the prequel to the last book. Each book focused on different members of the main families; however, the previous books' characters continued to make leading appearances throughout the series.

I found that with the third and fourth book, it took me a bit to gain my interest back as the author switches and focuses on different main characters instead of keeping Derrick and Kristina front and center.  You are left trying to guess who the Rogue is as you get further into the story, turning it into a who done it mystery.  I was pondering how the author was going to resolve all the subplots to explain why she spent so much time focusing on other characters and was it really necessary to go off on these different tangents,  then I am left questioning if the series really ends at four books.

As always, romance is never far behind the mystery, but as we've come to know in Edelheit's writing, nothing is revealed until precisely the right time. The timing in these devilishly complex novels is always perfect, and I have yet to be disappointed. I think that the amount of research that clearly went into this book (regarding art, forgeries, etc.) shows the depth of dedication this author has to her craft, and it shines through in every page. Samantha is as quick-witted and clever as ever, and the bizarre cast of characters she moves through in this novel keeps readers on their toes every step of the way.

I was wrong.

If you're going into this like I was, expecting something along the lines of Harry Potter type magic then you're going to be disappointed but don't let that deter you. There is magic in this book just not like you'd imagine.

The book is more of a mystery than about the magic.

The book centers around the Carnival. In the US it would be more like the Circus. For us, the Carnival is a small traveling group of some rides but mainly chance games and food vendors.

The Carnival is made of the nine families that started it under unusual circumstances that imbued an otherworldly aspect into it. Magic.

A crucial part of this magic is The Gift. It is integral in keeping the magic alive and is the one thing above all else that cannot, must not, be tampered with or ignored, for the failure of The Gift would mean the end of the Carnival.

The book opens with a tragedy. The loss of the single most important part of the Carnival. The Ringmaster. We learn that within the nine, each family has charge of the various positions that together make the Carnival run. The Giftmaster, the Chancemaster, the Thrillmaster, the Foodmaster but the top is the Ringmaster, that without would surely spell doom for all. As it has always been, it is assumed that the next in the family line will ascend to the top of their specialty even though challenging for a position is well within the rules of any bloodline, it is unthinkable. Until now.

The past has come back to the Carnival and nothing will be the same for those that have lived and breathed the Carnival. The past will not only bring in outsiders, unthinkable challenges, and hardships, it will bring death.

The book grabbed me from the start. It sucked me in and the skill of the author was very apparent when she was able to invoke memories from my childhood of visiting the Circus, The smells, the sights, things I hadn't thought about in years. The Big Top tent, the Elephants, and who could forget the Clowns? Once someone is able to transport you to another time in your life then you know your reading quality.

It raised many emotions. There was laughter, sadness, and a fair bit of anger. There were more than a few times I looked away from the story, angry at something I'd read that to me, seemed implausible. Maybe a character acting so very different than I thought they should, or a situation that you just know would never happen, but in the end, I couldn't put it down and finished it almost straight through.

A real treat to read and I would recommend to anyone that has ever visited the Carnival, or Circus. It really is magical to be transported back in time when things seemed simpler and life was much more carefree.","When an author transports you back to other times in your life, you know you're reading quality work",3,9/12/2016

I couldn't stop reading and was a little disappointed I went through it so fast but at the end, there was a link to Book 2 and, well, I was hooked. I just finished Book 4 and I cannot wait to read another!  I love the twists and turns the story takes and just when you think you know what is coming, another turn takes you someplace you never expected.  It's a great emotional roller coaster ride - I fell in love with Finn, had mixed feeling about Kat's attitude changes, felt sickened and saddened for the characters caught up in the many abusive and murderous cases through the series, and joy for Daniel and finally for Drake.

The character of Kat was increasingly developed, as was Finn in many ways. There was better continuity of the story, as opposed to To Kill For which was just to many stories that were not well developed. No character development of Jamie and don't know if that will get better with the next book or not. I do intend to read the next book since this one was more character centered and I like Kat and think I like Finn. For those reasons I rated this book at 4. The meat of the story is slowly revealed and is a real dozzie. The story moves in a smooth and believable manner, it could have been take straight out of newspaper headlines.

She also happened to be well educated, very successful and well respected in her career as a top notch brain surgeon. She was really her own person, and needed really no one to make her feel complete. That is until she starts to look at Frank more closely. It was then she knew she wanted more out of life than what she had. It might not be a life with Frank, but she did want the adoring husband and childen.

So what if her hair was completely gray, mine was completely gray by the time I was 25, too. It's a family trait amoung the female members of my family. Just because it may make you look older, you still have those same wants and needs that everyone else your age craves.

So she wasn't the most social person around. I think that had a lot to do with the way she was brought up; it was mentioned that her mother happened to be an introvert and barely even talked to her as she was growing up. Being introverted doesn't make you a bad person. They are just someone who still needs to find a way to open up to more that the world has to offer them....and I think Frank was the key that finally made her spirit want to soar.

I also like Amanda, and I still want to know more about her. I hope she gets a story of her own one day. Didn't much care for her boss, though.

Maggy is clearly a fighter, but even without Conor, shes going to keep on fighting. Hes certainly macho enough, but Conor is almost more vulnerable than she is.

This had a great start but it ending felt flat and weak.

On her way to her parent's house, Helen gets into an accident with Benson.  Helen is going to home to stay with her family because her father is sick.  Benson is in the same town as Helen because his sister in-law is sick.  Helen and Benson begin a relationship which I think is very sweet and romantic.  It is insta-attraction, but not insta-love.  It had points in a story that I love, but it failed me.

My issues were that after Helen sees Benson holding his pregnant ex-wife's hand in the auditorium, there is no big explanation. The kid is not his.  Helen may have originally run, but I felt like she was the one asking for them to get back together.  I still have no idea why he was holding his ex's hand.  Benson said it was not what it seemed...whatever that means.  I like some angst, but with the angst must come some groveling and there really was none.  I don't think he even said I am sorry when he came to her house.  My opinion of Helen changed at that point.

Also, I felt as if the first 8% of the book was a lot of unnecessary detail.  The ending felt rushed and epilogue was weak.  I barely read the epilogue.

3834,2,A2UP87V5B2NTFS,B00KNJFQ4I,"I only gave it two stars because (as far as I have read it , about half lenght) the hero and heroine don't do anything truly despicable. Not that they do too much at all, the story being about them reading the book sitting next to each other.
My first problem was what others also mentioned: that the main story and the embedded one (the book written anonymously by the hero) were so similar that I got confused all the time what happened really and what they only read about. Also, the scenes and the style was repetitive to the point of boring: the hero and heroine met at the bookshop, they both felt attraction/lust; soon they were reading about a heroine described by the very same words (willowy blonde) in the exact same situation and the couple having lustful thoughts. The real couple prepares for a ride to an acquaintance's outdoors party, and in the next chapter we read about the (doubly) fictional couple actually taking a ride to an outdoors party. The only clue is the names (Evangeline and Jeffrey vs Geraldine and Mathew - and even there, the female names are similar).
My next complaint was the total impossibility of several situations in Regency. A young lady was left to live alone without a female relative or chaperone because her brother (the head of the family) travelled on scientific expeditions. She had a godfather who secretly followed her to her outings ""to protect her"", and who spied on her through the butler, but did not think to take her around in society, although he was married. Several times it's remarked that she doesn't go to parties and balls because there is no one to take her (and yet, suddenly she is to go to the aforementioned morning outing). She was (although the butler was reluctant) allowed to entertain a male caller (the hero). After so many breaches of acceptable Regency conduct, the H is rigidly avoiding admitting his love to the h and proposing because he had not asked her brother's permission. As if in any Regency romances it would have been necessary!
Now for the  H's inconsistent behavior. He writes a book (and hopes to gain substantial money from it - unlikely in itself) but he writes all his contemporary ton society members into it with minimal name changes, salacious gossip bits, openly described crude male talk in clubs or the lustful explicit thoughts of his character - and expect no one will call him out for slander? Or for writing scandalous material unfit for ladies? But the most improbable thing of all: does he not know that his heroine is modeled on the young lady he is reading the book with, and he desribes himself hving sexual fantasies about her, as well as her having sexual thoughts about him - for all society to see and for the lady to discover it sitting next to him? He is constantly suprised to see what he had written...

3835,4,A2AU421QKGNRBF,B00KNJFQ4I,"What I was expecting is a real bodice-ripping book with a gorgeous woman and a hunky guy. It wasn't like that but it was still good.

Jeffrey Sommers is a baron down on his luck with debt that's not actually his. In an attempt to increase his coffers, he writes a book about a man and a woman of the aristocracy, modeling his characters from people he knew and places he frequented. He doesn't put his name down as the author and merely uses the name, Anonymous.

On release day, he rushes to the book store to buy the first copy. He desperately wants to see what changes his publisher has made. When he arrives at the store, he finds the book in the hands of a woman who has every intention of buying it.

He tries to bargain with her, telling her he will buy her another copy if he can have the one she has. She refuses. They decide to read the book together.

Evangeline is a part of the ton and finds the book, ""A Story of a Baron"". Pegged as a ""bluestocking"" (an intellectual or literary woman. Yes, I looked it up), she thinks she will never marry because basically everybody thinks she's boring.

As Lord Sommers and Lady Evangeline read this book, she starts making connections between her brother, who is an adventurer, and herself. She eventually draws the conclusion that Matthew Winters is actually Jeffrey Sommers.

This is a cleverly written tale and I would have given it five stars but the ending dragged and there were a few typos. The story overall was very good, the plot never wavered, and it was just fun to read.

It made me laugh sometimes, especially when Sommers would think, ""I'm going to hell"". I don't know why but that cracked me up!

3844,5,A1UH21GLZTYYR5,B00KO0G82A,"This is very much not my usual time period for historicals. But it worked for me. Holy smokes, it worked.

Melody and Annie's determination in the face of their terrible circumstances felt very real. I teetered between wanting them to run to get as far away from everything they could and beating Melody's husband over the head with something blunt. The guy was awful. The things he forced Melody and Annie to do were awful. I wasn't sad to see him go.

On the other hand, I liked Cole. He's tormented by what he's seen and done, but he's a fundamentally good man underneath his gruff exterior. That he had no idea how to seduce a woman he was interested in tickled me pink. He was just so...grumbly and sweet all at the same time.

Molly O'Keefe builds this story and romance around the very specific loss and grief and numbness that affected the country and the pain specific to these people.

3847,4,A11SU50CLR9ME1,B00KO0G82A,"This is the first book I've read by Molly O'Keefe and it won't be the last. Historical romance is my favourite subgenre but I'm increasingly jaded by the kind of anachronistic, indifferently written and not very emotionally involving books that proliferate these days. This book has a grittiness and pragmatism that felt very refreshing, but it had moments that touched me too.

The wounded war hero is a historical romance staple but this book portrays the lingering effects of the Civil War on everyone who went through it, in a way that feels realistic. Melody's determination to settle for comfort rather than risking heartbreak is understandable and Cole's insistence on a genuinely loving relationship after all the grief in his past makes him a very appealing hero. I loved the fact that these two don't immediately lust after each other; Cole admires Melody's sometimes unfeminine strength and she is charmed by Cole's ability to nurture seeds into plants, and the way he steadily goes about building for the future.

These are thoughtful characters who reflect on how the war has changed them and what they now want from their lives. They are both aware of how they are helping each other to emerge from traumatic experiences. There is a sense of historical time and place in this book that comes not from historical details but from the attitudes and emotions of the characters.

This book isn't perfect; some of the early actions of Melody and her sister in the face of her husband's brutality don't make much sense, and I ultimately became impatient with Melody's stubborn scorn for Cole's romantic dreams. But as I kept reading I kept wishing that more historical romance was like this, with characters who are shaped by their time and who deserve their happy ending.

3850,1,A11P0OD0BYF229,B00KOJW20I,"I very rarely give a one star review for a book, because I understand what it's like to write on a deadline, but I couldn't let this one slide.

I gave the first book in this series a resounding 5 star review. It was well structured, it told a portion of the story which was intriguing and I genuinely liked the characters. I didn't envision Cat's strong conflict boiling down to what it became in book 3.

Book 2 was less believable, and so were Cat's internal reactions, given that she'd created the 'plan' all along. It didn't make sense to have her shocked internally, when she knew what she'd planned. She wouldn't have to hide those details from herself, and since the reader sees the internal landscape of a character, this made the story less believable.

Book 3 was a travesty when it came to that particular factor. Everyone died. Everyone. The author, instead of creating a well thought out plot and implementing it over a further few books (or lengthening this one for that matter), tried to squish as much into the finale as possible.

Cat became a vessel for the story. She had no conflict in the third book. She acted and thought things she shouldn't have, given that she knew Jon was the perpetrator all along, and what she had planned.

The timeline was terrible. Even at the end when I thought the timeline jumping was over, the author couldn't resist adding an extra timeline jump back to Cat killing Jon herself, even though he'd already been shot three times and miraculously survived.

The emotion was trite. There was no accurate scene description. The sex scenes broke the flow of the story and were gratuitous, rather than involved in the flow of the romance.

Cat did no sleuthing, but ran around from place to place, leaving clues for a private investigator, who then disappeared instead of doing what he was hired to do by Ash.

The romantic conflict between Ash and Cat was entirely absent, apart from a few punch ups which showed Ash didn't but Cat was too busy sleuthing to trust her fiance with the details of her quest, putting her husband, friend, self and marriage in jeopardy. That's not a likeable trait in a person.

EVERYONE died. I'm all for killing a darling for the plot. But this was ridiculous. The Davenports died, Maxwell died, Gray died, Jon died, Cavin died, a pregnant girl died along with her baby. Lots of dead rich people on a yacht. The author killed off all the main conflicts. I refuse to believe this book was planned from the start (though I did suspect Cavin) because there is no way the author who wrote the tight, well written prose from the first book did so with this ending in mind.

With all of that said, I think the book suffered because of two main problems:

- Not enough word count, but no choice to increase that word count
- Not enough time to meet a deadline for this book

I wish I could unread this, that the author would write a proper ending, and we could have real closure.","Spoliers in Review. I wouldn't bother with this book, regret buying it, the first two were good and this totally let them down.",4,5/24/2016
3851,3,A2A41ZRVMO8WG2,B00KOYAUAM,"3 complete installments that are interrelated but independent from each other. Very graphic sex scenes within BDSM lifestyle.

Captured Innocence (***)
Connor Ortega is a private investigator for Crest Security Agency. The members of this Agency seem all to be members of different BDSM clubs and so it's no surprise that the  victim is connected to this life style. What makes this case special is the fact that the victim is the wife of Conner's boss's best friend. Soon Connor meets Laura who designs jewels for the lifestyle. The sparks fly but how does Laura fit into the lifestyle and what about the murderer?

A lot of kinky and graphic sex scenes that overshadowed the plot greatly. The romance part of the book completely dominated the suspense part. Anyway, not a bad book but fewer sex scenes for the benefit of a more refined suspense part might have produced a more balanced outcome.

Sinful Resurrection (****)
An interesting and riveting suspense romance involving Jax Christensen and Emily, the love of his life. Two years ago Jax and Emily staged her death. Her absence in Jaxs life has impacted his personality and behavior immensely. But now she's back, surprising Jax greatly. Her life is in danger and  she trusts only Jax and his friends to keep her alive. Jax and the team have no doubt about keeping her alive but what about the feelings between Jax and Emily?  Can they reconnect seamlessly to their past or is the present driving them apart?

A well written romantic suspense that kept me riveted. The balance between romance and suspense was better maintained that in the previous installment, the sex scenes better integrated - although I did have my difficulties with the graphic content of these scenes. The HEA was perfectly done and a great crowning of the installment.

Renewed Faith (***)
Elle is the manager of Jaxs and Connors club. As an ex-prostitute she is no stranger to the darker sides of life and lust - yet she hasn't had any contact with the lifestyle, except managing this club. Of course she has realized that Kevin seems to be interested in her but this is a feeling she isn't accustomed to and she doesn't know how to handle this emotion, except by pushing him away. Kevin comes from a loving and caring family. He's in love with Elle but all his attempts to win her over have been unsuccessful until recently. Now he has to take more drastic measures as a serial killer seems to kill prostitutes and Elle is still connected to this milieu.

The suspense part of this installment was completely overshadowed by the romance between Elle and Kevin. I appreciated that he knew what he wanted from life and how to persue this. Elle, on the other hand, gave me a really hard time as her reactions were between immature, egoistic and spoiled. I know that one can't chose with whom to fall in love with but I wished for a better partner for Kevin.",Hmmmm... some good - some bad but all kinky,5,7/15/2017
3852,4,A2JPS7EMNFKXOV,B00KOYAUAM,"I read and reviewed book 1, Captured Innocence, as a single download before purchasing this boxed set. I loved Connor and Lauren's story and just had to keep reading more about CSA. My full 4 star review is under that single title.

Book 2, Sinful Resurrection is Jax and Emily's story. Jax is Connor's best friend at the CSA. Emily was also mentioned in the first book. At first, Jax was not one of my favorite heroes, but as the story unfolded, my opinion changed for the better. By the end of the story, I was totally on board with both characters.

Book 3, Renewed Faith is Kevin and Elle's story. In this book I really had an opportunity to get to know Kevin and his interest in Elle, which was mentioned in book 2. I liked Kevin from the start, even though he is not as intense as Connor or Jax. I felt sad for Elle and the uphill battle she was fighting.

Let me first say that Kennedy Layne is an excellent writer. Her style is easy to follow and her descriptions and dialogues are believable. All three of the books in this set deal with individuals who are grappling with their pasts and learning to move on with their futures. The alternating points of view really helped flesh out each personality. Each story stands alone and comes to a reasonable conclusion. However, there is an over riding threat that was still unresolved at the end of book 3, but it did not mar my enjoyment of the individual plots. I did enjoy the continual interaction of featured characters with other characters featured in past books, which gave more details of the past characters continuing lives together.

Lastly, I must again say to all who are offended by harsh language and very explicit sex, this boxed set is not for you. However, if you can see beyond that and get into three very good stories with action, suspense, tenderness, angst and extremely emotional journeys, then I can definitely recommend this set.","This set will be a great read for some, but not for others.",3,6/8/2017

Good:
The first book is pretty good. I am not a part of the BDSM lifestyle, but there was  plenty of storyline to go along with playing. This story was well-written, well edited and without many noticeable grammatical and punctuation errors. I liked it.
Not So Good:
The second book is not nearly as good as the first one. It was very .... drawn .... out ... it ... dragged ... along ... for ... way ... too ... long. There was way too much BDSM in this story. The sex ""scenes"" read almost like an instruction manual. I wish the Author had spent as much time describing how the characters felt as she spent describing sex toys and equipment. There was very little chemistry between the lead characters, although they said they loved each other. And, unfortunately, the storyline in this book was weaker. I stuck with it to then end so I could see how the story ended, but it didn't end - there was a cliffhanger.

Frustration got the best of me during the second book in the bundle, so I didn't even read the third book. It could be very good, but I wasn't willing to wade through the possibility that it would be more like book #2 that book #1, so I just didn't go there.

3859,5,A1OPVTUNNA4OX2,B00KQ2G81C,"The Rock Harbor Mystery Collection by Colleen Coble -- First, although I normally hate series books (where the main character's lives continue through book after book with all of their angst), I LOVED this series.  (I do like series books where one book revolves mainly around a couple of characters and the following books pick up and follow the lives of a character/s introduced in first book so that each book is actually a stand alone book.)  Each book was well written, good character development, good set development, etc  and lots of suspense with a few twists. Although, in my opinion,  there were some lesser parts which were somewhat boring repetition but not enough to detract from the story as a whole.  Apparently, this series was an earlier work of Mrs. Coble.  There was love, desperation, who dunit and some angst (but not overly so in my opinion).  Each book could have been a stand alone but one really needs to read all of the books to get the big picture.  There was no sex (Oh, wow, an excellent series with no sex!  Go figure!)  The violence was implied not descriptive (What!  Now we have to engage the imagination?!  Horrors!)  There is romance, although I thought we were going to lose Cade for awhile there.  For me, the most difficult book of the series to read regarded Samson and dog fights.  I feel very strongly against such things and thought I would not make it through that particular book.  Spoiler Alert:  it turned out well.  Colleen Coble covered many issues which Christian and non Christians face and dealt with them well.  This series is an action/adventure/mystery series with no preachy passages.  There is a lot of suspense and a very surprising twist in one of these books.  I recommend this book for all ages. I would love to see another book with Bree and Cade and their wonderful family. I have read most of Colleen Coble's books and enjoy them thoroughly. I do feel, personally, that this is one of her best books/series.  Sadly, there is no Audible for this series. I usually get the Audible versions.  I would love to hear Aimee Lilly do more of the Audibles for these books.

3860,5,A2QRFHJ2MOY662,B00KQ36SGQ,"I was captivated by this series after my first glimpse in The Raid. This new world novel is something unlike anything else that we have experienced in the blossom zombie novels. The concept of robots taking over at first glimpse might seem a little outlandish, but I firmly believe Keary Taylor can make anything work. She created a story that slowly introduces you into an alternate reality. One in which technology is quite literally almost the end of human kind. The only chance of survival is the very things about us that make us human, and our ability to process thought unlike computers. Taylor incorporates a suspenseful love story between Avian, West, and Eve that will keep us guessing. I personally fell in love with all three of these characters, and could find reasons for the outcome to sway either way. Eve is a power house character, and I love Taylor's ability to create her soft and hard all at the same time. This is a young woman that knows how to take you down, but she will only at the cost of those she loves. Avian and West are both wonderful men that prove time and time again the lengths at which they are willing to go to be the protector. It is almost impossible to choose, and I must add that I personally chose wrong. The conclusion was not at all what I had expected, and I love a story that can turn the tables on me. Eden is a powerful post apocalyptic story about hope and survival. There are many lows of heartache, but this is a book of progress.

Banes that have been around a long time are smart, fast, and powerful. The nanites were supposed to help humanity live longer healthier lives, but of course something went terribly wrong.
Its a nice change from the typical ""random virus causes everyone to either rise from the dead or get all CHUD-y"" (that name comes from a bad 80s movie of the same name, a chud is basically a still living ""fast zombie"", stronger and faster than a human and completely feral and aggro)
 I won't spoil any character development, so Im not going give any plot details until I have to.

 The story is well written. Main chars do have development, and even some ""flavor chars"" get developed. Theres a few minor spelling errors, mostly homophones like chord (as in music) instead of cord (a thin woven rope), peaking (as in dropping LSD(?!)) instead of peeking (sneaking a glance) and so on. But they don't really distract from the book, unlike many other indie books I had to 1-star and spend an entire review talking about how the book was unreadable due to writing mechanics. So thats a plus.
The characters, for the most part, are well written and their motivations make sense, minus a few annoyances. Most of the plot is good, again minus a few annoyances in the last book, which I will outline in the ""plot spoiler"" section.

The bad-
For starters, theres a lot of romance. No sex descriptions - it all happens off scene with a chapter segue like ""and he wrapped his arms around me as our bodies meshed together"", so its not graphic. But theres a huge stupid love triangle through most of the first and second book between the heroine and two guys vying for her attention as she tries to figure out who she is (a major plot point so I won't go into more detail) Of course she chooses one eventually, and the other acts all butt hurt and does dumb dangerous unrealistic-for-the-endtimes stuff and they punch each other out a couple times like highschoolers.
 I'm female, (and based on the writing style I think the author is too) but I cant stand romance novel style romance, especially in my sci fi. Chars being in love is OK, vying for affection is ok, occasional descriptions of tender moments or the char mulling over/reacting to emotions here and there, great. But not when the main char spends pages agonizing over their feelings and the men in the love triangle act like boys, theres lots of ""mushy stuff"", and the main love interest is like Adonis, and he and the heroine are ""i cant live without you i love you so much you are my reality"" mushy constantly. That bugs me.

Its still a decent read, but thats one of the main annoyances. The others are a deus ex machina and the heroine becoming an ubergod, both in the last book. And then the series ending.

*plot point spoiler alerts ahead*

 First, the deus ex machina. A Bane shows up wearing a helmet, but does not attack. His face is still human. He still has all his mental faculties and can speak, which is explained away by the helmet hes wearing having some kind of anti nanite field that he built when he found he was infected. He also happens to be one of the main scientists who built the original nanite serum who conveniently knows a way to stop all the Banes permanenently using the heroine. Thats.... convienient.

Second, the heroine learns for reasons I won't go into that she has the power to control one or two  Banes, command them. Then something happens and she has the power to control hundreds at a time. She can order them to suicide, freeze in place, find others of their kind and kill them, don't touch humans, serve her high tea. Whatever. So suddenly a terrifying unstoppable enemy becomes less harmless than a single average shambling zombie. Blah.

Its like the author either wrote herself into a corner or got bored and wanted to wrap the series up, not sure which.

And the ending... God! it seems the author wanted both to have the heroine die a tragic noble death and live happily ever after. So she does both. 10 days after the heroine died saving the world and is buried as her love mopes around in the now safe and Bane free world, she miraculously comes back to life and unburies herself due to a ridiculous plot twist, involving her twin sister cutting the heroine and herself sharing blood with her secretly (way earlier they learn they both were experimental prototypes for the nanites and they are the only ones who have the nanites work the way they were supposed to.) and lives happily ever after. Whhhhaaa?? It is described as ""if she did this to anyone else they would turn into a Bane but since they are identical twins the nanites went to work rebuilding her body the way they were supposed to"". Yet theres plenty of scenes where the heroine is injured/bleeding and is bandaged, especially before she knows what she is. Even if it took blood to blood contact for someone with the ""good nanites"" to infect others, all it would take is a tiny cut to touch her blood to turn someone into a Bane. Stupid.

If the author absolutely needed to have the heroine live happily ever after, I can think of a few ways just off the top of my head to make it work better than it was written... Example: she flatlines on the operating table and they sadly announce time of death after frantically trying to save her. Her sister comes up with the blood idea, and the scientists say ""if your nanites enter anyone else theyd just deactivate as they recognized they were out of their host, but since you're identical twins...etc"" (avoiding the ""why didn't anyone bandaging her before she knew she had Bane nanites turn into a Bane"" issue).The sister tries it, and for days there is no change as the heroine's love mopes around. People say he should give up. Suddenly when examining her body in an imaging machine the scientists notice active nanites. A few days later she wakes up...etc. I came up with that in 5 mins. Its still bad, but way less so.

Overall, this trilogy is decent though. Better than a lot of apocalypse/zombie books out there. Its got some major flaws, but fans of the genre will enjoy it, especially if you like romance.","Decent, but too much romance. Dumb ending.",4,5/31/2016

Witty banter in the opening scenes made me think we had two main characters worth some real connection and chemistry. I remember having the impression that this is one of the few elevator scenes I've read that I could really relate to.  She was busy doing everything she could to get out,  having concerns I'd be thinking, myself.

The supporting cast had rich personalities that added fun and color to the story. I just didn't get the feeling that there was enough growth of the primary relationship, or enough interaction to really explain some of the thoughts the primary characters were thinking when they were separated.

I liked that they were taking it slow,  and almost felt satisfied at the projected hope in the relationship continuing to grow. The full and purposes of some of the characters just didn't seemed developed like his mother,  and the mischievous would-be interfering female who would throw in wrenches wherever she could.

Jamies love life is sunny and warm since a former high school boyfriend is now a current one. Kip Simons is the Director of Broward County Parks. He MBA put him in the corporate rat race which turned out not to be his thing, so he earned a degree in Forestry and Park Management. This new job fits his temperament, but office politics has become a major headache and vandalism seems to be running rampant. Someone seems to be leaving snarky comments at various parks; the latest, mowed into the grass, says, Bite Me. Then theres the I-C-U email, surveillance photos, threats, and a dead private investigator.

Jamie tries to help Kip, but he is less than forthcoming about the threats at work. He worries about her safety and she his sanity, but a sleazy developer, disgruntled employees, and jealous co-worker make things difficult. Jamie is also hoping that one day soon her father will be granted permission to come to the United States. Grace has some suggestions, but the red tape may be too much to cut through. Will Kip and Jamie expose the political shenanigans in time? Is the happiness Jamie dreams on the horizon? Will everything be bulldozed?

This is another delightful, entertaining book and possibly my favorite! Barbara continues to develop Jamie Quinn into a more confident woman personally and professionally. She has given hope that Jamies personal life is happier with the, albeit Skypish, relationship with her father and her boyfriend.

3873,5,A1XD1M9Y7HZ13I,B00KRQ0E1M,"Peril in the Park (Jamie Quinn Mystery Book 3) - This is the third book in Barbara Venkataramann's engaging series.  I listened to the audio book narrated by the wonderful, almost addicting vocal talents of Carrie Lee Martz.

Carrie Lee, as the first person narrator's voice of Jamie Quinn, is perfect - touching, wry, tough, and vulnerable in turns. As the voice of the other memorable characters she is outstanding. It made this mystery very very entertaining. The author has the ability to write a naturally flowing story, nothing seemed forced or contrived. I read the first book in the series, 'Death by Didgeridoo' and the second book Case of the Killer divorce. This book continues the story of Jamie and Kip, but could also be read as a stand alone book.

I was delighted to see the return of PI Duke Broussard. This time he's assisting Jamie in a personal matter. Kip, Jamie's boyfriend, is having problems with the parks he manages. There is a vandal at work. Then Jamie gets a threatening message and she is drawn into the mystery of who is doing this. I love Jamie in her ""lawyer mode"", she's smart, but never loses her sense of humor. I love her realistic approach to problems, her vegetarian life style, and her cautious nature. Barbara Venkataramann has created a character that is never cloying, foolish, swooning or implausible. Her books are not padded with filler, they move right along, keeping my interest.

Best bits: I do like the family dynamic and brotherly support.

Issues: The whole story balances on the contradictions in these supposedly-near-perfect characters. Blues main personality trait is supposedly being a caregiver for people--yet he can't take care of his fiancee by explaining himself, and feels drawn to travel the world instead of sticking around to care for his family. And kind, sweet, nurturing Sarah is apparently self-centered enough that her own embarrassment makes her unable to see his emotional struggles and unable to even try to listen for an explanation.

3886,4,A21OIC0RJWPQG,B00KU28VCW,"I will admit that the author has a horrible taste in cover art and he seems to have a fixation on lesbian relationships.  That said, you'll never mistake his covers for someone else's--due to the legendary tackiness of the art that no one else uses--and at least we don't have to read about the size and shape of every guy's dong, unlike in a certain vampire hunter series I could name.

This is a super-hero novel.  If you enjoy the genre, you should enjoy this novel, and the ones that follow.  I started to criticize this story like I would most other stories I read in other genres, but the author specifically wrote it to *feel* like a super-hero story, as if you took a comic book and put it in prose.  Yes, the protagonist gains super powers rather easily.  Yes, she automagically attains female goddess measurements with no real effort on her part.  How many comic books show heroines with realistic stats, though?  It seems silly, but the author is being true to the comic book super hero theme.  In fact, he may very well have purposely set up the story to depict the silliness inherent in comic book works.

I liked the characters.  There is a fair amount of development in them.  For the reality paradigm they live in, they seem to make realistic decisions I found myself rooting for the good guys and hating the bad guys.  They were all believable.

One negative aspect of the novel was that the author, being British, used many British spellings of common words, despite the United States setting and dialogue.  The dialogue, mostly, came over as very American...I'm actually astonished that there weren't more slips.  I'm something of a spelling and grammar nazi, though, so many of the British spellings stood out to me and interrupted the flow of the story, from time to time.

Having grown up reading award-winning Science Fiction and Fantasy, when the awards actually meant something, I can appreciate that, while there was a lot of sex in this novel, most of it was actually inferred, rather than actually written out in play-by-plays.  You knew all the characters were having lots of sex, but most of it was in your imagination.

I noticed a few reviews going off on all the sex and lesbian relationship drama, but the author has taken comic books and attempted to translate them to a world where there is no censor to protect the children from some of the consequences of actually having a super-powered minority.  Characters that find themselves suddenly thrust into a small community of folks who are going to be feared and distrusted by everyone else would probably also realize they should find relationships wherever they can, because they won't be very common.  Gays and lesbians, now, tend to stick together because no one outside their communities really understands them.  Combine that with being outcasts even among THAT group, and I would figure on super humans really only able to have relationships with super humans, who understand them, or at least share a common experience.  Now add to THAT, the fact that many of these people are risking their lives daily, and they probably see the need to ""live for the day, because we may die tomorrow.""  I'd be having sex like bunnies too, and I wouldn't be all that picky about partners.

3889,3,A2D3OV7946T614,B00KUQIU7O,"This was an intimidating book to start. Go on its Goodreads page and you'll be greeted by a teeming sea of four- and five-star reviews. Also, it's expensive AF. I was really interested when it came out but the ebook was $9.99! $9.99! That seemed way too excessive for a book that not only wasn't in print form and therefore couldn't be lovingly toted around by me to and from my daily battles with big city public transportation, but also meant that I would be out almost $10 (that's two and a half small lattes from Starbucks!) if I didn't like the blasted thing. Luckily, it went on sale last year for $1.99 and I decided that the price was right.

The reviewers, however, were wrong.

I almost DNF'd this book at the 100-page mark. I couldn't believe it when I was greeted by halting, overwrought prose and a raging Mary Sue of a heroine named Agony (not her actual name, but her narrative induced throes of agony and it's close enough, so) who put even Queen Special herself, Addledstar Galactica, AKA Celery to shame. And then, when she finally meets the fearsome Dragon himself, instead of eating her...he makes her do CHORES?!

If I hadn't been invested in my buddy read with Elena, I would have dropped this potato so fast.

One thing that well-meaning fans do that really actually kind of gets on my nerve a little is tell me that a book is ""going to get better"" and that I should stick out my misery to get to the amazeballs ending that will be a total game-changer. I know they mean well (most of them, anyway), so I try not to get too annoyed about it, but it's a really frustrating thing to hear - ""wade through this festering pile of boredom and inaction, there's an amazing ending four hundred pages down the road!""

Also, 9 times out of 10, they're wrong.

This is the 1 time out of 10 that the fans are sort of right. Around the 200-mark or so, when Agony and Dragon encounter the Wood, it starts to get interesting. Mostly because it stops feeling like a Medieval Guide to Domestic Drudgery and starts feeling like a classic horror novel. The heart-trees are freaking terrifying. I have the flu right now, and in the midst of a fever dream last night, I thought that the coat I had hanging on my closet door was a sprouted heart-tree, come to drag me into the woods. I almost screamed. It was so terrifying. It made me thing that Novik ought to give up fantasy for a while and try out writing an atmospheric horror novel instead. I haven't been so creeped out in ages. The magic system was interesting, but not very well-developed. It actually reminded me a lot of another fantasy novel I recently read, called THE BURNING SKY, where shouting foreign-sounding words Makes Magic Things Happen. That book also had a rather slow start and dreary protagonist. I felt like there was a five-star book buried in the heart-tree of this novel, screaming to get out, but it was utterly bogged down by the pacing, and the tell-not-show of the first person narrative.

One thing I did really like was the ending. It actually reminded me a lot of Moana (if you've read this book and seen the movie, you'll know what I mean). There is a definite feminist bent to this book, too. Agony's friendship with Kasia is more developed than her attraction to Dragon, and in many ways, I felt like Kasia was a stronger heroine than Agony was. I also liked the Moana-like twist I hinted at earlier, and I also don't think it was a coincidence that Agony, a female mage, was the one to do what she did. It reminded me of this Tweet I saw written by a survivor of abuse, who said that when she watched Moana, it made her think of the healing women can give each other in the aftermath of abuse, and the powerful bonds that form because of that sympathetic relationship. If Moana is an allegory for that, I think you could argue just as easily that UPROOTED is, as well.

That said, this book still had a lot of problems. Ultimately, I am glad I finished it, but it won't be topping any of my favorites lists, and I'm a little bewildered by all the unequivocal positive ratings. I'm intrigued enough that I'd be willing to check out her companion book set in the same universe, SPINNING SILVER. Novik has a style that's very similar to old school Diana Wynne Jones, and even though DWJ's books didn't always work out for me, I usually appreciated what she was trying to do.

This modern fairytale has it all; an interesting magic system, strong and compelling characters both good and bad, an interesting plot that capture the reader and refuse to let go. Already after reading the first two pages I knew that I had walked straight into a trap, and that it would be impossible to get loose until the last page was turned. Contrary to the trend in the genre this is a stand alone novel, and not a part of a 3+ book installation, making it both dense and fast paced. There really is a lot of book in this book (if that makes sense). It is not dragged out, there is not a lot of filler in between, you really have to keep your head straight and bull through! Sometimes reading this book feels akin to running a marathon! I really don't know what more to say, but at the same time what I have said does not seem adequate at all! I think I will finish by saying give it a chance, read and see for yourself. This is really an unique book that I can recommend whole heartedly.",There really is a lot of book in this book.

3892,5,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,B00KUQIU7O,"Sometimes I look over the reviews of a book before I post my own, just out of idle curiosity, and I was interested to find that there is almost no middle ground on Uprooted. People love it or they hate it. Me, I loved it in spite of its flaws, which I count as hella good story-telling. And flaws it does have. The ""hero"" of the book, known as The Dragon, is a jerk. Seriously, there's no other way to describe him. He has a past which explains some of it, and the fact that he's shut himself up in a tower with only a single peasant girl (one is taken every ten years, then sent on her way, wealthy but seemingly rootless) for company. He doesn't really like the girls, has very little interaction with them in spite of the persistent rumors of him having his way with them. He has cut himself off from all but the most basic human contact for over a century. Why wouldn't he be a jerk? He's forgotten how to treat people.

So on a year of the choosing, Agnieszka expects that it will be her best friend, Kasia, who is chosen. Kasia is gorgeous, good, graceful, everything Agnieszka is not. But it'sAgnieszka who is chosen instead. And from that moment, her story becomes something quite different from the one she had expected to live. She has magic. Agnieszka also has a healthy ego, she doesn't take The Dragon's assholery seriously once she realizes that he's teaching her to be a witch. She knows she's good at it, she understands magic at a gut level which is something even The Dragon doesn't seem to do, being a wizard of rules and precision. Yeah, she's a bit of a Mary Sue, but we never get the transformation into gorgeousAgnieszka who is desired by all who gaze upon her perfection. Rather you get a rising heat between her and The Dragon, which they manage to deny until it's a meeting of equals, andAgnieszka's conscious decision.

I'm not going to get all shirty about the rules of magic here. They are what the author says they are, nothing more or less, and complaining about how magic ""doesn't work that way"" seems fairly pointless to me. I liked the feel of it, so I accept that it works the way Novik tells us it works. More than that, I liked the feel ofAgnieszka's magic which is friendly and homespun. What she does in the end seems to me to be a direct result of how her magic has developed over the course of the book.

Had it ended withAgnieszka doing the work she'd chosen for herself, I'd have been completely satisfied because it's a story of a young woman finding her path in life. She's helped by her teacher, given strength and purpose by her best friend, and the other people in her village who she cares about. It's a story about how an awkward girl becomes a woman who finds her voice, and the best expression of who she is in the magic she chooses to do. In one thing about her magic, The Dragon was spot on:Agnieszka is a healer, and by the end, we see how powerful that gift really is.

Uprooted is poorly written, the author uses long passages of mumbo jumbo spells apparently as filler which made me want to stick pins in my eyes.  Its a lot easier to write a book where the basis upon which everything happens is its magic than actually having to develop an actual plot.  I found the book like being in a torture chamber for more than 400 pages which may have been better than reading this book

On one levels its a very, very bad rip off of George RR Martin, with heart wood trees, walkers in the forests and encroaching death.

I can't decide if this was targeted for fourth graders - no disrespect to fourth graders  But I think it uses too many big words.

3895,5,A92C5VO4UDJZP,B00KUQIU7O,"The predominant factor of a 5 star review for me is whether or not I like the hero/heroine of a story.  I love everything about Angnietska; from her self-deprecating humor and realistic expectations of herself and people around her, her willingness to accept everything about people and herself, even the darker aspects of her own heart, and her intuitive sensibility that helps her navigate her magic and her life is really everything I could ever want in a heroine worthy of my following her from the beginning to the end.

I really couldn't put this down.

The Dragon is a delightful grump, a court dandy turned hermit who is brilliant and frustrating, and a worthy hero/love interest.  There isn't much romance in this book, but of what there is, it's tasteful and adult at the same time.  He is her teacher and towards the end, her refuge.  But I love that she isn't necessarily defined by whether or not they stay together.  She is definitely her own witch with her own sense of purpose and doesn't need a man to define that for her.

This isn't so much a romance novel as it is a fantasy mystery mixed with horror at times.  As Agnietska follows the story, unravels the mysteries of the forest, we hope she doesn't have to sacrifice herself to save the valley she loves.  At times the story was a little bit ""Ring"" and the antagonist's minions a little bit ""children of the forest"" but it was pretty exciting.

One star for the stellar heroine, one for the riveting mysteries, one for the back drop of Russian folk-lore, one for the grumpy hero, and one for the engrossing writing style that doesn't let you go, and when it does, leaves you wanting more.","Strong, messy heroine saves the day",3,9/20/2017
3896,3,A3L07QNZ3XUNVY,B00KUQIU7O,"The book was way too full of gratuitous violence for me to really enjoy. There are some wonderful and unique characters and twists of plot, so I do think the book is worth reading for its imaginative qualities, and the strength of its heroines. I ended up skipping through the final battle scenes as there is just too repetitive use of the same ways of killing over and over again....However, there was a nice and darkly compassionate twist to the plot near the end which I thought redeemed the book in many ways. Looking at this book through the lens of ""Would I want my daughter to have this fairy tale in her head?"" makes me respond like this: Life choices are difficult and have consequences. The actual ending dismayed me, and I hope it dismays other readers instead of bedazzling them into thinking that a woman's smile will overcome what the heroine is about to face.

Agnieszka lives in a small town on the edge of the Woods, a malevolent forest that separates two kingdoms encroaching on both a little at a time. On Agnieska's side, it is held in check by the Dragon, a wizard up in how tower that her town is beholden to. Every 10 years, they pay the price of giving up a daughter from one of the town's that survive by his protection and this year Agnieszka is chosen even over Kaisa. She is confused until after a few days it becomes apparent that he is trying to train her. She has power although it's a kind that he is not familiar with but maybe it's the power that the kingdom needs if it is to survive what the Woods has been in store for it.

A rich world built with a tremendous amount of depth and attention to details. The characters were equally deep and complex as are their relationships.  I thought the story dragged a little in the beginning as things were getting set-up and there was a lot of me wanting to reach into the book and smack Agnieszka...a LOT of times. There were a few times later in the book but I think I was so engrossed with what has happening to notice them.

3898,1,A3PSJT6ATI12Q1,B00KUQIU7O,"I looked to see if there were other poor reviews before writing this because I thought I must be missing something. I am 'only' 77% through the book and honestly I don't know if I will finish it. I find the story tedious and the writing onerous. I wanted to enjoy this book as I am a fan of the genre and my expectations were high with all the rave reviews, but it is not to be. I find her writing odd. For example, her human characters pant - a lot and often. Perhaps if a woman is in child birth she pants (I wouldn't know) but I'm quite sure I have never panted. I find it an odd description to use on a regular basis. I love forests - truly love them, all trees and wildlife. Love to hike. So to find a ""wood"" that is evil and causes all kinds of destruction didn't sit well with me. Perhaps it is supposed to be like a ""fairy tale"" but I always felt they treated nature in an ignorant scary way that was not honest. I'm not inspired by any of the stilted characters. And at 77% of the way through I don't really care what happens to any of them. And the story keeps going off in some 'other' direction and I find it all very confusing. For the life of me I can't figure out where she is going with this story line. Gads. I hate writing reviews like this but this book obviously isn't for every one.

(Names and to a considerable extent customs are pretty clearly based on Poland, which was the birthplace of Noviks parents.) The first-person narrator of the story is Agnieszka, a seventeen-year-old girl. She lives in a valley ruled by a wizard known as the Dragon, though hes entirely human. He is, however, a couple of hundred years old, but looks like a man in his prime. And he has a practice of every ten years having all the 17-year-old girls in the valley gathered in one place, where he chooses one to serve him for the next decade. He does not, as some outsiders believe, actually eat them; at the end of the decade they are sent away with substantial gifts. But none of them are ever satisfied to remain in their home village when they're released; they may stay a month or two, but before long they all leave for the capital of Kralia, where they may take up posts at the university, or marry a city man, but they never return to the valley. Agnieszka was born in the year from which he would pick a servant, but everyone knew that KasiaAgnieszkas best friend from babyhoodwas sure to be the one picked. She was the most beautiful, the most skillful in domestic arts, had the nicest personalitysuperior in every way. But then of course he picks Agnieszka instead, which throws everyone for a loop. The menace is the Wooda forest that has slowly spread from the mountains out into the valley. The Dragons principal task is to prevent it from spreading further, but it has been creeping onward for all the time hes been in charge (and for a long time before that, when other wizards had had the task). It turns out that he is primarily interested in picking girls who have some magical talent of their own, and in that Agnieszka was the best in the valley. And they work very hard to prevent the Wood from expanding, but its not easy to oppose. A very interesting novel; I recommend it.",An Interesting New Turn for Novik,7,7/21/2016
3902,4,A23CJ40BNWGZO,B00KUQIU7O,"This is a very well crafted book with a traditional fairy tale meme.  Most of the characters are likeable.  The villains are completely evil.  Strong female protagonist.

This is a long book.  The first half will go very fast.  To resolve the conflict, in the last 25% of the book the characters make some bizarre decisions.  It all works out in the end, but I did not find the characters actions to be believable to their earlier depictions.

3903,3,AU2V0FIBAEGXN,B00KUQIU7O,"I'm very conflicted about this book. I had heard great things about it, and when I started it, it was immediately clear why so many readers sing its praises. It's beautifully written, and the Wood is the most chilling, most disturbing, and most imaginative villain I've ever encountered in literature. I also loved the bond between the narrator/heroine/Chosen One Agnieszka and her best friend Kasia, which is the central relationship in the story. (This book easily passes the Bechdel Test.)

And yet, as I read, I developed some serious reservations that lead me to warn that this book is not for everyone. First, it's pretty gruesome and violent. That doesn't bother some readers as much as it bothers me. It wasn't gratuitously violent, and the violence was in keeping with the plot, but it was disturbing enough that I couldn't read this book before bed -- and since bedtime is when I do the lion's share of my reading, it took me about five times as long to read Uprooted as it usually takes me to read a book of this size. That always reduces my enjoyment a little, because the more I have to stop and start, the more disjointed the reading experience feels.

The second thing that really, really bothered me, was the ""romance"" aspect between 17-year-old Agnieszka, and the Dragon, the centuries old wizard who takes a 17-year-old girl as a servant every decade. Because of the age difference and the vastly differential power dynamic between the two of them, the physical aspect of their relationship was super squicky and inappropriate. It also wasn't very believable or compelling. The Dragon was grumpy old goat, and Agnieszka could have admired his wisdom and guidance without wanting to get in his pants.","Beautifully written, but I have serious reservations",9,3/4/2016
3904,4,A4FFK8M1P0Y9,B00KUQIU7O,"I absolutely loved this book for a couple of hundred pages.  The book grabs you immediately and pulls you in to an authentic, amazing story world.  This book was different from any other book I'd ever read, and the premise was fascinating.  As we got closer and closer to the end of the book, however, I was not as enchanted.  This book starts out stronger than it finishes, and I wasn't crazy about the way it ended.

The main character is interesting and believable - until [slight spoiler alert] she gets involved in a sexual relationship that was entirely unbelievable and bizarre to me.  It was like the author thought ""Oh, yeah, I gotta throw some sex in there, here, let's do this...""  It SO did not fit the personality of the main character [or the love interest, for that matter].  It was just weird and awkward.

3905,3,A2XKR4AN0ZRGQ5,B00KUQIU7O,"Actual Rating: 3.5 stars

I don't know if I just had too many high expectations going into this book based off of the multitude of rave reviews, but I found myself struggling many times to get through this book. While there are definite parts of the book that are fast paced and action packed, there are also many that lag and seem to go on and on with nothing whatsoever happening. In many instances, I felt there was too much descriptive language that could have been cut down or taken out completely without it detracting from the story.

This is not to say I didn't enjoy Uprooted. I did. I found the Wood fascinating and the Dragon enthralling, but I thought many of the other characters were blas. In the scenes where Agnieszka and the Dragon are bickering or when the fighting takes place, I was riveted and excited. But then there would be pages of dull (in my opinion) narration about people and things I didn't care about. Maybe it was my lack of connection to all the characters that caused me to find some of this burdensome.

I would definitely recommend this to fantasy lovers and those who love narration deeply entrenched in lore. It is robustly descriptive and in a way reminded me of Lord of the Rings (but this just may be because I read so few high fantasy books).",This is not to say I didn't enjoy Uprooted.

3906,5,A2G2UBV6M821DU,B00KUQIU7O,"I'll be honest I didn't think this was going to be a great book; I just sort of got this odd sense that it would fall flat because the heroine was talked up to being ""super normal, super plain"" and supposedly was going to have a story-hogging romance with a young-looking wizard who is mega old. The title also wasn't the most attractive so I wasn't expecting beauty. (Also the $15 price tag threw me a little...)

But, surprisingly, this was an excellent book and it was beautiful too. For a standalone, it really felt full of story. Space wasn't eaten up by unnecessary things and there was so many events and bits to the plot. I was thrilled as I kept reading and found that the whole book wasn't eaten up by the heroine in her tower being romanced by a wizard with only a fraction being dedicated to action and larger plot devices (in fact, romance is just a blip detail in this book, there's far more focus on saving the world and the friendship with Kasia and all that kind of stuff, which was refreshing).  The characters were awesome and there were bits and pieces of details that made me go wow!!! because I rarely see authors include these aspects. The story was amazing from start to finish.

Overall, it was a gripping, entrancing read. I think I'd like to see another book set in this universe, perhaps focusing on Kasia this time or going further back in time to focus on the Wood Queen. I honestly can't say anything negative about this book outside of the fact that the massive age gap between the two leads. But since this is such a small detail to the overwhelming amount of story, I didn't feel it appropriate to take away any stars for it.

3907,4,A1QUQ19QLC2WZB,B00KUQIU7O,"This book contains everything that I don't care for in books.  It is a fantasy novel set in medieval times.  There are mythical creatures, fight scenes, and some heaving bosom romance.  Yuck, yuck, and yuck.

But I REALLY enjoyed this book!  I believe it is loosely based on a  Polish fairy tale, which made it more palatable for me.  Every ten years, a dragon-wizard come to the village and takes a 17 year old girl.  No one knows why or what happens to her, just that she never returns home.  The dragon a usually picks the best girl, but this time he chooses a plain and clumsy girl.  The story follows her life in his tower, what she learns, what she teaches the dragon, and how she tames the corruption of the Woods.

The story is well told, complex, and held my attention.  The women are strong, wise, and powerful.  The writing style allows you to visualize the story and the action, just like a good fairy tale.  The fight scenes and the struggle between good and evil had me on the edge of my seat.  As I was reading, I was reminded, in a good way, of scenes from the movie The Princess Bride.

Will I start reading fantasy novels?  No.  I also don't feel compelled to read her other work, which is in no way a negative reflection on Uprooted.  This book is a great winter read--best enjoyed with a cozy blanket and your favorite hot beverage.

The mother is a total flake and she leaves the kid because she has something better to do.  He hasn't a clue what to do or how to do it regarding kids.  he does try though.  He wants to do well for this child.  His next door neighbor is the heroine.  She is a single mother and she knows it all.  She puts him down at every turn because he is not the perfect dad and should know what to do regarding the child.  She just pissed me off.

I could not stand her or her attitude.  The story has a good plot line, I loved the hero.  The children in the story were even good characters.  it was just he heroine I couldn't handle.  I would recommend that you read the book and see how it all plays out for you.

I was not paid for this review.  I am not an author nor do I know one.  I am a reader and this is just my opinion, nothing more, nothing less.","loved the hero, ther heroine not so much",11,3/8/2016

It just mainly stays on everyone and the main problem. Then it ends with a cliffhanger and I realize this is a different type series that interweaves everyone together. I kept reading expecting some type ending for the first couple  and would have then been satisfied with series cliffhanger, but noooo. Instead it is an all around cliffhanger and the story focuses too much on everything and not enough on Violete and her groom.

But worst than all that it is only in the oldest sister's  POV and she was my least favorite. She was so narrow minded and focused in feeling bad for the bad guy, yet was so mean to her employees. Arguing with her sister against the two elder employees getting half day off to see their wedding because they had to work. Rose was right they were more family than the guardian , and they have kept the ranch going. So I didn't buy Violet was such a good person with those bad qualities.

17 years ago......Jenny and Clay were high school sweethearts, who had been in love for years. Right after Clay heads off to college, Jenny realizes she's pregnant. She travels to the college an hour away just to share her news, but before she can tell Clay that she's carrying his child, he tells her he wants to break things off with her. She is so distraught she walks away without telling him about her pregnancy. Clay didn't want to break it off with the woman he loved more than life, but he was young her father had made threats against Jenny and his mother. He felt like he was doing the right thing back then, because as far as he knew... her father's threats had real merit, or so he thought.

Back home and scared to death of what her father will do if he finds out she's pregnant, she runs into Clay's best friend, Joseph. She tells him about what happened with Clay and the situation she was in. He agrees to marry her both to give the baby a name, and to protect her from her fathers wrath. A few years later Clay comes home to find his best friend and Jenny married and with a child. He is so hurt and upset that he goes back to college without another word to either of them. Later he marries a woman he doesn't love, because she's pregnant with his child. Their marriage is rocky from day one, but he does what it takes to make things work.

Now 17 years later..... Clay comes back home for a few weeks to take over for the hometown doctor, so he can enjoy a long overdue vacation with wife.  Clay is now divorced and raising his 2 daughters all alone after his wife walked out on him and their children, with one of the doctors from his practice a year ago and hasn't looked back.

Jenny lost Joseph to cancer 6 months ago, and both her and her son Nathan are having a rough patch of sorts. Just when she thinks things can't get worse, she runs into the one person who has the ability to turn her life even more upside down than it already is.

Secrets and lies always have a way of coming out just when you least expect them to, turning your world upside down.

I love this town and it's cast of characters. The close cameraderie between Izzy, Becky Lee and Jenny is one to be reckon with, for sure. They have each others backs through thick and thin, and will always stand strong and united, against anyone who tries to hurt one of them. If that means keeping a secret that has the abilty to impact several lives for 17 yrs, then so be it.

I am curious. I've read Izzy's and Jenny's story now and was skimming through all of the other introductions in the upcoming books, trying to find BeckyLee's story....but I didn't see one.

3949,5,ASEF3BKWVH4W5,B00KX7F73A,"This memoir begins with Claire returning to Manila in September 1941 after some time back in the States. Manila is having black-out drills and there is a rather humorous little story about a black-out drill and a bathroom window. On 7 December 1941 Pearl Harbor is bombed by the Japanese and on 8 December bombs are being dropped on several places outside Manila. War has arrived in the Philippines. As the situation gets more precarious, Claire moves out of Manila but very soon it is obvious that the Japanese have taken the Philippines, and Claire ends up spending months hiding in the hills and mountains with her Filipino friends.

Claire is spirited back into Manila and acquires false documentation, after which she opens a night club and embarks, with others, on a perilous course, smuggling food, news, and money into POW prisons, and also supplying a guerrilla group. The night club is a clearing house for gathering information, both military and naval to be passed on. On 3 May 1944, Claires precarious balancing act fails and she is arrested and taken firstly to a small cell in the grounds of the Japanese Administration Building where she undergoes a first round of questioning, before being taken to the dreaded Fort Santiago. She is put into a cell with six other women while fifteen other cells contain around 200 men. Prisoners are dying from disease and starvation as well as barbaric torture and very soon Claire undergoes horrific torture. Then the tide turns and American bombs start hitting Manila and the surrounding area.

This book is very hard to read in parts, and I am sure Claire has left out some of the most graphic suffering she and others endured. It is one womans account of the part she played in the Philippines during the war, although she doesnt just write about herself, but also about others, both American and Filipino, who all played their parts in the same dangerous undertaking. It shows the reserves of courage and endurance that ordinary people can draw upon when needed, and also shows the opposite side of the coin. No-one knows which side of the coin they will be on until they are actually faced with such a situation.

First I want to say that I really liked the cast of characters. All different, but all learning to survive this mess together. The interactions between the different people were good and seemed genuine for the most part, and I really like Tyler for some reason. Maybe because he's the kid of the group? I dunno, but I like him.

The zombies are rather typical, but there is a slight twist in the way they behave according to their environment, and I enjoyed seeing that! The survivors have their theories and discuss them, trying to work things out, making this a novel of not just surviving, but working toward an actual explanation if nothing else.

I feel like this author's writing is only going to get better and better, and look forward to reading more from him.

Bob says: 3.5 Platypires!",Bob @ Platypire Reviews,2,7/1/2016
3952,5,A5QQLCBLQFXBO,B00KX8FXEM,"This is NOT your typical zombie genre novel.

I love fiction, especially apocalyptic and zombie genre fiction.  I enjoy reading more than watching television or movies, although I do that also.  I guess my ability to visualize what I read is more entertaining to me than what someone else visualizes for me, therefore, reading only gives me the ideas, but my mind gives me the pictures.

I received the book free, as I get several emails from companies that give you email lists of books available for free on Kindle.

A lot of free books have many typos and grammatical errors, which I find to be the norm when it comes to free or bargain books for my Kindle.  I am a  grammar ""nazi"" myself, but I am very forgiving when it comes to books from authors that do not charge the standard ""best-seller"" rates that come with publishing companies that can afford the best of proofers and editors.

This one, however, was quite low when it came to mistakes, and I believe most of those were basically because of the setting and probably the location of the author.  Those of us who are in the USA and are originally from here know that our language differs a bit from other parts of the world that also speak and use English.  That being said, anyone who complains about that or has a problem with it, readers have a head's up on the fact the writer creates in this fashion.

On to the reason I state this is not your typical zombie novel.  Most zombie stories are just stories of the survivors and what they do, how they act, how they treat each other, etc.  This book is similar in that, however, the internal thoughts of the main character, John, seem to be the focus of this first book.  The author is very descriptive and wordy (not in a bad way), but obviously the author is also a pretty intelligent person who probably does not need to use a thesaurus, but many of the readers may need a dictionary.  Lots of big words, descriptive sentences, and probably not the ""fastest read"" for most casual readers.  This is not to say it is difficult to read, but more that it is just not a typical novel.

The story is quite good, but the beginning is mostly just the internal thoughts of John.  It may seem slow to some, but know that it is for a reason.  In my opinion, John's perspective is important to understand the struggles he goes through mentally.  The start of the novel is important to understand, so that later in the novel the reader has an inside view to his mind and how he processes the situations he finds himself in.  The reader will see that at one moment he is full of despair and wants to give up, even contemplates suicide, yet the next moment he finds a way to see hope in the situation and decides to fight again.  It is a realistic view of a multi-dimensional human being who does not just fit in to a ""type"" of character (such as: the leader, the brain, the weakling, the soldier, etc.).

I do look forward to the other stories in the series and hope to find the characters to continue to be enjoyable and more real than the majority of novels that stick to stereotypical character roles.

If you like fiction, especially survivor/zombie fiction, I highly recommend this book.","A Really Good Read, but a Few Things to Consider if You Expect a Typical Zombie Book.",5,6/2/2016

3957,5,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00KYC5TF0,"Alaska author Tom Hoffman comes to young adult (+/- childrens) literature with a degree in psychology from Georgetown University and a BA in Oregon College of Art. Toms career has embraced being an artist, a graphic designer, and now an imaginative writer. Having read his Book 1 of his Orville Wellington Mouse series, beginning his earlier series the Trilogy -THE ELEVENTH RING, THE THIRTEENTH MONK, and THE EVENTH MEDALION - brings even more pleasure  the retrospective sort.

Tom takes a chance with this book, stepping into science fiction using animals as characters, and it works very well indeed. One of the reasons the story hangs together so well is his well-considered anthropomorphic stance of his characters. Without stooping to the cuteness of todays high money making films of animated stories, Tom keeps his level of sophistication very high indeed. His prose is luminous and makes the pleasure of reading the story all the more satisfying  adults can enjoy this book as well as teens, and for teens it presents a fine adventure tale in the language of sophistication that hopefully will replace the current acronym mode of communication fostered by the Internet and media!

For example, Tom opens his story thus: A gentle breeze carried the delicate fragrance of ten thousand newly bloomed orange blossoms across the balmy summer air. It was far too early in the season for the trees to be bearing fruit, but the intoxicating scent of the blossoms floating through the grove was more than enough to satisfy Orville Wellington Mouse. Besides, strolling alongside Orville beneath a gloriously radiant summer sun was his best friend in the world, Sophia Mouse, and that alone made him supremely happy. Sophia had moved to Muridaan Falls only one year ago, dropping like a bossy know-it-all gift from above into Orvilles life. He was drawn to her immediately, even though at first blush it would seem the two mice had little or nothing in common.

But before Book one of this trilogy Tom maps the course woof what we will expect: The Bartholomew the Adventurer Trilogy is a romping tale of adventure set in the far distant future after humans have vanished from the planet. The protagonist is a self-centered rabbit named Bartholomew who sets out in search of a missing object which he is unable to describe or name. Along the way he meets his adventuring companion, Oliver T. Rabbit, a brilliant scientist who also undergoes a deep transformation in the trilogy, coming to understand that there is no magic, only science, whether its time travel, parallel dimensions, manifesting physical objects with thoughts, or reincarnation. Their adventures take them to lost cities, parallel universes and other planets, along the way meeting a host of memorable characters including ancient robotic rabbits, the Tree of Eyes, the Singing Monks of Nirriim, the Blue Spectre, and Edmund the Explorer.

The tight synopsis gels the tale well  Sent to the Cavern of Silence by his servant Parfello, Bartholomew Rabbit begins a quest to find the mysterious Great Gem. He is aided along the way by the Tree of Eyes, the nefarious Skeezle Brothers, and his new best friend Oliver T. Rabbit, a renowned scientist working for the Excelsior Electro-Vacuumator Corporation. As Bartholomews self-awareness and magical shaping skills grow, his quest transforms to a search for his dearest childhood friend, Clara Rabbit. To save Clara from certain death, he must defeat the evil and powerful Zoran the Emerald Shaper, wearer of the dreaded Tenth Ring.

Titillating? Yes, and all the more so as the reader becomes involved in this highly imaginative interplanetary sci-fi little tale. This is a very successful series. Grady Harp, August 16",He speaks with her in his dreams but forgets their words.,2,8/1/2016

""Fimblewinter"" is the first book in a series about a screwed-over, down-on-his-luck software jock who's selected by a goddess to protect her high priestess from the devastation the Aesir wreak during the long winter preceding Ragrarok (the end of the world, Norse version). Our boy of course proves well up to the challenge.

I've read the series of three books (16 hours, you bastard), and it's a very well-thought-out extrapolation of real physics laid over a medieval society. One aspect I appreciated is that the protagonist goes through a long learning curve, and quite a few screwups, on his journey.  Definitely looking forward to the next few books.

Are you one of those players that scoffs at games where the player is given massive powers to destroy his enemies, and instead wants a burning challenge to ignite his ego and needs drudgery and sacrifice disguised as ""Challenge"" to keep himself interested?

Then you will hate this book.. because this story is for people who want our games to escape our regular existence and start off really powerful.

Daniel Black is a guy that has his real life turn horrible and in his moment of greatest dispare he is given the option to enter a new world with the powers of a mighty sorcerer.  Even better he gets to choose his powers, and like many ""character optimizer"" (or ""munchkins"" as they are vulgarly called) Daniel and us KNOW how to make a powerful character.

So he ends up in this new world, brimming with power, and begins to win.  Just win.  Battles, Women, Property, Everything.  Does he have it pretty easy?  Yes he does, because he PLANNED IT.  He did not enter this world saying ""I think I want the powers of a janitor, maybe with a beer belly, but sort of strong.""

Our hero, Daniel, is offered a do-over by some magical spirit; since Daniel's life is in the toilet: he lost his job, he catches his wife cheating on him and he finds himself in the hospital after a serious car accident, what's not to consider?
The storyline is great, a modern guy transported back in time to a Middle Ages European fantasy world, but he has great power and knowledge, sweet!
William Brown does an excellent job of describing how Daniel attempts to solve problems with his advanced knowledge. What I especially liked is the supporting cast of characters, all of which fit in nicely.
The writing style is similar to Elliott Kay (Good Intentions & Natural Consequences), high praise in my opinion.
If I were to be critical, on occasion the conversations may have mentioned a new world word which would not have any meaning in the Middle Ages, hardly anything to get hung up on.

Cheese, Cheese, Cheese

I found quite a number of errors in the text portion of this book. There are wrong words, wrong tenses, but my favorite one is ""causes irritable.""  The errors aside, there are some things I don't agree with. You can't fix an immune system simply by giving it nutrients. I'm sure many people with auto-immune disorders wish it were that simple. The authors haven't stated ant credentials, and the second half of the book contradicts the first half in many ways.

They use the term ""junk food"" a lot. But I would argue that ""bread"" made strictly from fried cheese is as much junk food as anything else. Or crepes made from syrup and cream cheese. Only syrup and cream cheese. Sure, those are no carbs, but I still think many people would classify them as ""less than good for you.""

So many of the recipes have a lot of cheese in them. If you're trying to watch calories, a lot of these recipes are not going to be your friends.

There are many other books out there that have better credentials, better information, and better recipes. I'd give this one a pass.","Cheese, cheese, cheese",2,7/1/2016

Here is a few pointers but you must order it. applesauce.  Pour in the cooked oats and mix well.  Add the 1/ 2 cup of raisins and 2 tablespoons of honey, combine, and then spread into a 13x9 inch baking dish.   Cover and refrigerate overnight.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for about 55 minutes. The food we eat can act as nature's pharmacy. Just as a real pharmacy has some drugs that we are better off not taking, so it is with food. And just like a real pharmacy has drugs that are highly addictive, so it is with food. If you eat the right food, the body will react by being healthy. If you eat the wrong food, (junk) the body will react by being unhealthy. The good news is that even if you are on an unhealthy diet now you can turn it around by eating healthy are possibly reverse the damage inflicted by the junk food. To explain it better, nutritious food will work to strengthen the immune system. A strong immune system is able to fight off germs and infections, whereas a weak immune system will leave a person susceptible to germs and infections. All that has to happen to turn a weak immune system strong is to give the body what it needs, nutrients. These nutrients are absent in junk food but are present in abundance in nutritious foods. In order to claim the goodness of eating a well balanced diet it needs to be a lifestyle change. If you are accustomed to eating junk then your body may have a weak immune system. If you go on a diet for a while and start to feel better,
have more energy, and then go back to your old eating habits, the same old symptoms will return. You cannot eat junk food. You must eat nutritiously. Both of the diet plans in this book helps to make a good lifestyle change with the clean eating diet and the metabolism boosting diet. The clean eating diet consists of good food, which will work to clear the body of toxins. Clean eating is foods that are whole and without manmade chemicals. It is eating the way our body needs. The metabolism diet is good because it boosts the metabolism, which gives us more energy. If you have more energy you will feel like moving around more which is good. Physical activity is very beneficial for the body. So many people do not exercise as they should because they simply do not feel like doing it. This stems from a sluggish metabolism and almost always points back to a bad diet. So if you eat right by choosing the recipes from the clean eating diet and the metabolism boosting diet you will feel better, have more energy, and will ultimately be healthier. If you want to set your body on the track to being healthier, the diet is the best place to start. If you are accustomed to eating a lot of junk food, you will have a fight on your hand when you switch your diet. Junk food is highly addictive, as addictive as smoking. Start the first three to four weeks of your new diet with a good weaning from the junk food. This will help you to avoid the very unpleasant side effects of possible moodiness, headaches, and very intense cravings for the junk food.

Can you lose weight on this diet? That is a big yes. Why? Because by not eating junk food the body has a chance to use all the nutrients that comes from clean foods to help boost the metabolism. This means that it digests the foods at the perfect time, pulling all the necessary nutrients out. Because there are no bad fats or sugars in natural foods the body does not hang on to them like it does when you consumer junk food. Because natural foods help the body to speed up the metabolism, you have more energy and when you have more energy you feel like getting up and moving around. Developing and maintaining a good exercise routine is vital in weight loss and very possible when consuming clean foods because you will have that extra energy.

It is full of so much information to help you along the way, its hard to put down.

3975,2,A2T9ACKTR0HFYR,B00L0LQCQ4,"I wanted to love this book. I really did. It had such potential and the story could have been great. Everyone loves a good opposites attract story. It's clear the authors are good writer, some small editing errors aside, but dang, they needed some developmental help because...the story is just boring.

Honestly, reading this book was like dragging myself through molasses in January, inch by agonizingly slow inch. In more ways than one. I was only at 37% on my kindle when I just couldn't summon the will to care what happened next, and stopped reading for months. I finally picked it up again after almost a year, just so I could say I finished.

As for the slowness, first, both Zach and Jessie feel lust in every...tiny...thing. From the second they meet. Or rather, from the second Jessie hears his voice and sees his silhouette. (You'll understand if you read.) Jessie is grabbing plates and utensils and Zach's heart is about to beat out of his chest. Zach's wearing a hoodie and loose jeans, or just sweats, and Jessie can barely keep her hormones from filling the entire house. Every single second they're in each other's presence, and of course every millisecond they're apart, the narrative is drowning in their undying lust. I consider sexual tension vital, but this was sexual tension on steroids, and not in a good way. I tired of reading about it really fast.

When we're not being bashed over the head with hormones, it's copious details about the characters and their lives that are tedious to slog through. There was good, important stuff in there; stuff that gave us insight and helped us understand how the characters came to be the people they are. But there's tons and tons of extraneous detail (and repetitive detail) that just put me to sleep (literally; fell asleep twice while reading, on two separate occasions).

The most annoying thing is, it didn't HAVE to be boring. The story is almost all tell, no show. There was what should have been a pivotal conversation between the H/H during a car ride. Do we know what was said? Sure. Because the authors TELL us. Twice. But instead of unnecessary repetition, I wanted to SEE it while it happened. Ditto for the Thanksgiving scene. Everyone's doing the traditional thing, going around the table and telling us what they're thankful for. We get to hear just one character's speech -- and it was a secondary character! Despite the fact this isn't his book! However sweet, I just didn't care. I wanted to know what the H/H were thankful for, and I wanted to witness it firsthand, along with all the other Thanksgiving guests. But once again the authors chose to tell us what they said, after the fact, instead of drawing us into the scene by showing us. Letting us read what the characters were thankful for in that moment. And the whole book continues like that. It stood out vividly because the book is unbelievably short on dialogue. That's exactly what happens when you tell instead of show: narrative overload.

And then there's the heroine herself. The hero? He's wonderful and dreamy and so easy to fall for, despite his faults. But the heroine is just awful. Beyond her looks, I can't discern a good reason why he likes her. She's rude, self-absorbed, shallow, and she barely tolerates her own family. I felt a sense of coldness from her even during the love scenes (until the very end). And her control-freak issues are the stuff of legend. That 37% I mentioned? That's right about when she started divvying up the kitchen cupboards and the fridge space and the laundry room time because God forbid she doesn't control even the most minute detail of her life and living space. It was just too...ridiculous. It was actually uncomfortable reading Jessie. She reads like her skin is way too tight, and mine was feeling too tight just by sharing her anxieties. And she didn't have to be that way. How do we know? Because she's perfectly aware of her faults. And when you're aware of your faults, but you still do them, they become a choice. She chooses to be the way she is. I would have given anything to see her recognize her feelings and actively work to change some of her control-freak tendencies throughout the whole story, so we could really see her develop.

I just didn't find the book particularly sexy (sex scenes aren't enough), I didn't find the relationship particularly believable. I didn't think the story was fun or funny, etc. In the end, I did finish, but I skipped a lot to just to find out how the characters ultimately got together. I'm not interested enough to read other books in the series, unfortunately.",Hard to Get Through,8,3/8/2016
3976,3,A475KQYBF0THC,B00L0LQCQ4,"This book is ridiculous.  Yes, instant attraction is a real thing.  I was extremely attracted to my husband the first time I met him and the feeling was mutual.  With that being said, he was able to walk into a room without a raging erection and I didn't need to sop up the wetness in my panties after just a glance in his direction.  These people literally could not be in the same room without insta-horny.  They were distracted from doing their jobs because of raging lust after having spent approximately 2 hours in each other's company.

In the end they burn two people as witches to erase the curse and the crew, afraid the doctor will tell the tale of their murderous nature, lock him on board the ship as they are taken aboard a rescue vessel. The ending I will leave to you to discover, its nature being twisted as well. This is my first experience with a book by this author. She did a wonderful job of editing, or had it done, and there are no distractions nor editing problems of which I was aware.

It would appear the writer wrote the book in third person, but then decided to switch to first.  The book would benefit greatly from an extensive edit.
However, having said that - the book is an enjoyable horror story, and while the tensing issues did detract from the overall story - the spine-tingling essence of the story was thoroughly enjoyable, and will remain with me for some time.
Set in the early 20th century, the main character has left his newly-wed wife to serve as surgeon aboard a seal-hunting ship in the far northern lands.  From the very beginning, the scene is set for a fascinating story, as we discover that the Lady Balgay, upon which our character is travelling, is considered cursed - for a great many reasons by her crew.  Superstitious fears abound, and things only grow more complicated as time goes on, and soon we discover that this voyage is very much 'a voyage of the damned'.  The author has created a rollicking story, the pacing is excellent, and if it weren't for those problems I've mentioned, I would have happily given five stars.

Gavin and Leah were thrown together by circumstance that affected Leah's newfound extended family. It was quite early in the story that I started feeling I needed to put this down and read Ella Fox's other series. I didn't realize this was a spin off of her Hart series and a lot of what was being thrown in was what was happening to those characters. I felt lost and couldn't figure out whether I should stop and decipher where in the Hart series timeline Twist of Fate fell in.

I'm saddened by this. Because I liked Gavin. He was a great guy who was already at the point he was over the rockstar life and was ready to find what Flynn found in Tessa. Leah, was a good heroine. She was strong and a survivor. She'd been through a lot, but I still felt like her backstory was just being thrown at me for affect.

It starts off nice, you think there is going to be some adventure and suspense, after all, people are trying to kill the woman.  That hope's are quickly flushed as soon and Heckle and Jeckle are introduced.  Then it's ALL about sex with a small reminder there is supposed to be something else going on.

Labeling this as romance is beyond inaccurate. The main characters didn't show any love for each other, just an over abundance of sexual hormones. Sure, menages who love each other can have bouts of hardcore sex but that is all there is here and it's impossible to believe the men love their woman because she lets them poke her wherever while exclaiming how ready and needy she is.

The plot has holes a mile-wide. The two main male characters are werewolves and brothers and happen to chance upon meeting their mate when she's in distress. They take her home, unwillingly, and within half an hour there she's already having shower sex with one of them. The brothers worry about her being followed and tracked and although they take away her gun for everyone's safety they don't stop to think about taking her cellphone away? The villain deals in human trafficking and wants her but no one stopped to think that he might have the ability to track her phone for location?
By the time the girl learns they are werewolves, she insists on leaving the guys and they let her without any type of communication pleading how much they want her to stay. Ten pages later when they reunite it's all about sex in the playroom again which only reinforces that there is no romance in this story, just carnal gratification.

Consent is BIG in the BDSM lifestyle. Then to have a sexual relationship start the NIGHT all 3 met? Not very believable.

Kate teaches people how to look for their past family history and has promised an older Russian man that she will marry him in name only to save her families business.  His nephew Isaak finds out after he passes away and wants Kate to repay he and his brother the money Ivor gave to her.  Isaak has a playboy reputation and he decides to honor his uncles contract with Kate if she will consent to a one year marriage with him.  The next story is about Eli Jackson and Zoey Daniels who meet in online gaming situations where each player has an alternate identity.  They play every Friday afternoon with Eli's brothers and then finally meet at a convention center for gamers wanting to find out about new games being developed.  In each story there are situations that can bring you into the characters lives and how they get to where they are a this point in their lives.  Zoey Daniels has a heart condition that she will not use as an excuse to stop her from living life to the fullest.  Kate was shamed early in life by her mother into thinking that every sexual thing in life is shameful.  Each meets the person who will complete them.  I really liked each of these stories for different reasons.

I was at 51% on my Kindle, and kaBAM!.....done.  Imagine my WTH look on my face....imagine the massive confusion?!?  I loved this story though.  I don't think there's anything better to read than a romantic story of an intense, arrogant and wealthy playboy who is accustomed to having his way in all things, and he meets his match with an inexperienced and beautiful, but damaged young woman who won't back down.  Add some mystery and drama and it's just about perfect.  The only downside is the abrupt finish.  Talk about a cold slap in the face!

26 y/o Kate Edwards is an historian and genealogist who signs a contract to enter into a sexless marriage for one year.  She would gain 3 million pounds to pay off massive debt....he (Ivor Zaretsky) would gain freedom from scandal and a clean reputation...except he dies before the scam can begin.  Still, Kate collected the first 1 million pounds installment which Ivor's family comes to recollect.

Isaak Zaretsky is stern, intense and arrogant.  He seldom smiles.  When he comes to collect the money that was paid to Kate by his Uncle, for a marriage that never occurred, he reluctantly becomes charmed by her purity and innocence.  She's sincere, shy and conservative..not at all what he presumed her to be.  Since she is unable to repay the money, he decides to take his deceased Uncles place and marry Kate for the same reasons.  To repair his reputation...except going through the wedding, he doesn't realize that Kate intends to keep the marriage ""in name only""...as per the contract.

I loved how, being with Kate, Isaak finds some of the truths of his ancestry.  I loved how the mere presence of Kate begins the healing of the bitterness Isaak carries.  His cold demeanor begins to thaw.  He begins to smile and he finds peace.  Characters are brought to life nicely and I easily connected to each of them.

The Bride Who Wouldn't is the story between Kate, a genealogy teacher and Isaak, a Russian billionaire, forced into a marriage of convenience due to Isaak's uncle, who had actually contracted with Kate to do the marriage of convenience first, only to die before the deal can be consummated. Isaak, who was in need to a show-wife, decided that Kate is perfect for the role and forced her to accept. On their honeymoon in Paris, they will discover their passion for each other is real, and make some discoveries that will rock their beliefs.  Both characters are quite sympathetic, as they both managed to surprise each other time and time again, as each revealed their own hidden wounds, and the twists in the story are what made this novella special.

The Courage of Eli Jackson is a real gem though. It relied on the ""blind date"" trope, but with the background of a gaming / cosplay convention that paired Eli, a guy good with boats and online games, with Zoey, a cosplay queen and also online gamer, who get to bunk together (at the honeymoon suite!) in a gaming/cosplay convention. Both have hidden wounds, albeit these are on the plain side, and the twists in the story are relatively low-level.

This is a scholarly account of the downfall of the British aristocratic dynasty over the first 50 years of the 20th century. Think ""Downton Abbey"" losing everything.

Author Catherine Bailey alternates the narrative between the super-rich dukes and earls who owned Britain's lucrative coal mines, which was theirs for the keeping for no other reason than the coal was discovered on their property, and the men and boys who toiled in the mines for pay that was so low some likened their work to slavery. The former is filled with gossip, sex, scandals, more sex and the vain exploits of the rich. And did I mention sex? The latter is filled with the sad, universal stories of extreme poverty and squalor, but in this case those stories are covered in black coal dust. And then those stories merge with the might and power of the workers' civil unrest, coupled with their strikes and demands, leaving the aristocracy reeling. It was a complete and total sociological change in England with the dawn of the liberal welfare state that was purposely designed to improve the health, education, employment and social security of the working class--and leave the aristocracy in the (coal) dust.

4016,5,A2WEPN11EQPZCW,B00L2GPSIK,"Beginning with the outsize funeral of the 6th Earl Fitzwilliam in 1902, this book follows the family from aristocratic living at Wentworth House, the myriad dependents - later born sons and affairs with tragic consequences. The systematic destruction of all family papers and correspondence by one of the family leads the author to dig deeper in ever more remote locales - it is great to follow along and speculate about possible motivations. Ultimately, the book ends with the death of the last of the titled Fitzwilliams without being able to deliver a definite verdict in the matter. The life at Wentworth House is set within the context of the Earl as being the center of the Yorkshire coal mining industry - being involved (one of them even worked as a miner for a short time) in the life of the dependents as an ""enlightened"" owner. Nevertheless, the book manages to outline the grim life of people (and ponies!) employed in the industry. There are festive occasions of almost unbelievable proportions: scores of roasted animals, tents, free entertainment for all. Never forget the strictly enforced differentiation between the various dependents!

The heroine was funny but talked to herself A LOT. Lots of inner dialogue which made sense at the beginning because she couldn't speak the language, but later, it became a bit annoying, but she herself wasn't a bad character. The males were all well-written and I found their situation very sad, which made them more likable because they were vulnerable despite their size. Personally, I have no issues with reading menage books, but in this instance, I would NOT have made this a menage. I found the interaction between Lilly and Kieve very passionate and loving, and the introduction of Sieren and Tievel put a dent in that. As a reader, I already felt a true bond with Lil and Kieve.

4020,3,A354PQTUYPISKF,B00L2MQJX2,"The story is heartwarming, the characters sound but there is a problem with the overall construction of the book.
To explain.. The timeline is confusing and convoluted, by my best estimation the story must take place over a period of at least two years because in 1825 it would take almost that long to go to India and back to England regardless of how you went either overland or via the ocean (there was no Suez Canal) and yet the character Giles is there and back with Katherine's brother Steven before you know it. There are many other places in the story where the timeline gets rushed or confused, where characters change without pause or warning and you have to read back to see which one was the primary in the paragraph.
Another unfortunate flaw which I find is an issue with many younger contemporary writers is the placement of descriptives in a sentence ""her emerald loving eyes"" instead of her ""loving emerald eyes"", we can only suppose that her love of emeralds is extraordinary! And while I am a huge supporter of a solid vocabulary I feel it is imperative that the writer actually knows the definition and proper use those words. For instance, ""the gentile lady sat on the edge of the bed"" gentile...really? I had no idea the rest of the cast were Jewish. We must assume that she meant ""genteel"" (Kat's aunt) and this is only one example of misused words, there are dozens to choose from.

This one was full of surprises, and was very fast paced.  President Zimmer really comes into his own as he is plotted against again by yet another elite egotist who thinks he would be the ideal president.  However, the ante this time affects the entire world economy, and many players are involved.  It seems like two different stories are happening as Cal is pulled into a job with a billionaire's life at stake, while the story with the president is happening.  This time, the stakes are much higher, and the enemy is much closer.  There are many edge of your seat moments throughout the book, and the company is at stake as well.

In this book you will find Fasting means cutting back on portions and calories to meet a lower calorie intake 2 days in a row. I found by spreading out my food intake and eating more salads I never was hungry even though I took in less calories. I have a very physical job which I burn a lot of calories but still was in a holding pattern of weight loss since I started this fasting period on my weekends I am losing weight and inches. Very well written and easy to read. In this cook book it explains the reasoning's for intermittent Fasting and will leave you feeling satisfied with the reasoning's. I found the recipes easy to follow and very tasty. I am following the meal planner which makes shopping and meal preparations very easy. This meal plan tells you what days to follow fasting and which days to eat normally. Which has made it super easy to use and follow. Loving my new cookbook diet and you will too..

This one wasn't too bad, but as usual the h is young (16) when they marry. The H was 22. He marries her to get some plans from her father, and to protect her from her mercenary mother.

The story starts up basically 8 years later. The h seems to be very forgiving and understanding about the H many, many mistresses but there are a few things that had me take a star off.

First, there really isn't a grovel. She is too understanding. Next there are a number of plot threads that were not resolved. As in, most of them. There are several wannabe OW involved and his mother is a horrible person who throws one of them at the H continuously. None of those get resolved - they just disappear from the story. And the plans from her father don't work but that is never resolved either.

This new game allows you to experience anything that you can dream of, literally.  You plug in and all of your cares or fears wash away.  Everyone has plugged into it except Jake and Tom.  These two are wandering the destroyed lands after the world was left to rot when everyone plugged in.  Follow these unlikely travel partners as they try to find Toms son in this new wasteland.  Along the way they face off against an unknown enemy who is trying to kill them at what seems like every step.

After I finished this book last night, I knew that the review was going to be hard to write.  Not because the book was bad, far from it.  The book was interesting and unique in many ways.  But, because there is no way to write about how I really feel because it is a HUGE  spoiler.  I can say this, the book did NOT end the way that I expected.  I was really expecting a totally different angle to be take towards the end.  With that being said, I think the ending is what a lot of others were expecting.  It wasn't anti-climactic my any means, I think that some readers would feel like it was a cop out.

I couldn't help but drawing a ton of similarities from Wall-E.  Minus the cute robots, the characters were similar in both disconnection and girth.  Even the way the the city was supposed to be left made me think of this movie.  I don't think this takes away from the book a ton, but the similarities are definitely there.

The two characters were lovable and hate-able which made this book so interesting to read.  Jake is so optimistic and really tries to take their grim and crappy situation with a smile if he can.  Tom was almost his voice of reason, while being a pessimist. It was almost like a big brother, little brother type of friendship.

By the end of this story, all I could think was whats going to happen?  And Im here to tell you, even though this is supposed to be part of a seriesthe book has a proper ending (yay!).

Overall, this book was a weird combination of dystopian, sci-fi, and post-apocalyptic.  It peaked my interest and kept it, and gave me a surprise ending, which isn't always easy to do.",Whats Your New Reality Like?,3,1/13/2016
4045,3,A2AM29JUP54SFP,B00L6XR8FK,"Post-apocalyptic cannot get much bleaker than this novel in which two guys wander a seemingly endless landscape of rubble searching for sustenance. At face value, this set-up is akin to Cory Doctorow's ""Beat Me Daddy (Eight to the Bar)"".

The circumstances are more insidious, however, and really more like the Matrix movies when Neo is unplugged. Tom and Jake are seemingly the only freely mobile survivors of a corporate-caused apocalypse. Brutish bots scour the landscape shooting and destroying those not under the Rixon Corporation's control. Most people are mentally hijacked by Rixon's ""New Reality"" VR program that keeps them fed, fat and docile ever-occupied by their full-sensory diversion. Nobody unplugs from the Rixon headsets.

The men tried to unplug someone once, and Tom's wife died in the attempt. Now Tom's plugged son is their driving force as they try to survive long enough to help him to cruel reality . . .

But Rixon is watching from the lone standing tower on the horizon. And monsters burrow beneath the debris following the wounded men everywhere.

The endless repetition of the men's routine is mirrored in their frustratingly ""Waiting for Godot"" style conversations. It adds an existential element to the novel contradictory to the immediacy of the horror element. Most chapters seem to play out the same, promising to reach a climax and then cycling back on themselves at the start of the next chapter.

There is a third character that espouses her opinions of the guys' journey at the end of each chapter. She knows them intimately and watches their every move. This, too, adds an existential element, like the chorus of Greek tragedy. Likewise, she manages to add nothing to the plot for the bulk of the tale as she says the same things at the end of each chapter, promising to add conflict and then not following through.

By the end, things happen and everything become clear. The book stands alone, but there is a sequel that'll likely take this tale into stronger more interestingly speculative realms.

Both leads are given what should be heart-wrenching backstories, then the book focuses on them trying to get over those things. But the author just tells us about these things, reports them - she doesn't write them in a way we can see and feel what the characters saw and felt. Plus, her dialogues between the leads mostly unveil old stuff; they don't reveal any getting-to-learn-who-you-are-now-and-why-I-like/could-love-you-so-much. 305 pages of looking backwards.

Brief Summary of the Storyline: This is Hannah and Stephen's story. They met in a grocery store, and Stephen couldn't let her leave without asking her to go out to dinner. Even though it was completely uncharacteristic of Hannah, she says yes. They both have reasons to not jump right into the relationship and to keep their emotional distance, and they both struggle with their attraction and feelings of being connected. Eventually, they give in and start a relationship and fall in love. There are some sweet moments, some sexy times, and some drama thrown in...but the couple get a HEA ending

POV: This alternated between focusing on Hannah and Stephen in 3rd person narrative.

Overall Pace of Story: Ok until the end (see closure section). I never skimmed, and it flowed well for the rest of the book.

Instalove: No. I felt like they had sufficient time to develop stronger feelings.

H rating: 3 stars. Stephen. I liked him, but I had to take a star off because I wanted him to communicate better with the h.

h rating: 4 stars. Hannah. I liked how strong she was after her traumatic past. She was sweet and innocent, and genuinely cared for what she did.

Sadness level: Low. It did cover some heavy subjects, but I never needed any tissues.

Heat level: Moderate. They take a while to be intimate, but when they do they have good chemistry.

Descriptive sex: Yes

Safe sex: Yes. Condoms are used.

OW/OM drama: Mild

Sex scene with OW or OM: No

Cheating: No, once the H had his sights on the h he wasn't interested in any other woman (even though he was a manwhore before meeting her)

Possible Triggers: Yes

Closure: This had an abrupt resolution to the big conflict and then straight to the epilogue. I hate that! Why are so many authors doing this?!? The epilogue was cute and gave the couple a HEA ending.

How I got it: I paid the $4.99 on Amazon.",3.5 stars,3,4/11/2016

WORTH THE RISK is the second book in the McKinney Brothers series and it's quite different from the first book, WORTH THE FALL.  If I had to use one word to describe WORTH THE FALL, I would use emotional.  For WORTH THE RISK, I would use dark.  The suffering both Stephen and Hannah have experienced are briefly described in this story and be warned, it's not pretty and could be triggers for some readers.

After suffering a devastating loss five years ago, Stephen went to a dark place and distanced himself from everyone, including his family.  He feels responsible for what happened and believes he doesn't deserve happiness, until he sees something in Hannah that brings out his protective instincts.  Hannah made an innocent choice twelve years ago that changed her life forever.  She has no real interest in being with a man until she meets Stephen, someone other than her brothers that makes her feel safe.  I liked Stephen and Hannah and thought they made a nice couple.  Stephen was vital in helping Hannah achieve that final step in her healing, as was Hannah to Stephen.

WORTH THE RISK is told in dual POVs and while it's part of a series, it can be read as a stand-alone.  With the introduction of Hannah's four brothers (FBI, Army, Cop, Firefighter), I have to wonder if they will end up with their own series.

4049,4,A3CJSPKY795JOL,B00L73W2J6,"Overall Opinion: This was a sweet read. I really like the single parent theme, so I was happy to jump right into this one. I wanted more interaction between the H and the baby, but I understand that it is hard for an author to write those connections when it's a baby (I love it when it's a young child like a toddler or older). PTSD is a major problem that our society faces, so I think this would appeal to many people. I usually like to be warned that this deals with something like ptsd before reading (love those spoilers!), so if you're like me -- there are mild ptsd moments with some mentions of the H's traumatizing military past, but there are no major flashbacks with graphic details with H becoming belligerent. I also felt like the very ending wasn't all that believable, and I felt like it was written that way to tie everything up with a pretty little bow and not for realistic purposes.

Brief Summary of the Storyline: This is Becky and Logan's story. Becky is a struggling single mom that has a dangerous ex that just got out of jail and is threatening her. She turns to her boss and ends up staying at her boss' cousin's house. Logan is shocked to find the mom, baby girl, and dog in his home when he arrives late at night, but learns that his cousin allowed it and she actually proposes that this woman is the solution to his problem. Logan needs a wife because of a contract he signed with his dad that he'd be married by his 30th birthday in order to inherit a large chunk of property. He needs this property to build his dream retreat for military personnel suffering from ptsd (which is something that he suffers from from his own military service). They get into a contractual marriage, and of course it doesn't stay platonic and deeper feelings develop. There is some ex drama, some sexy times, some family drama, and some sweet times...and the couple finally get their HEA ending.

POV: This alternated between focusing on Becky and Logan in 3rd person narrative.

Overall Pace of Story: Good. I think it flowed well, and I didn't feel the need to skim at any point.

Instalove: No. I felt like there was adequate relationship development going on.

H rating: 3 stars. Logan. I liked him, but had some issues with him not communicating his feelings with the h.

h rating: 4 stars. Becky. I liked how she cared for her daughter, was a hard worker, and was upfront about her feelings.

Sadness level: Low. I didn't need any tissues.

Heat level: Moderate. They have some good chemistry. The scenes were decent, but not that many (which can be a good thing).

Descriptive sex: Yes.

Safe sex: Yes. Mentions of condom use and birth control.

OW/OM drama:Yes

Sex scene with OW or OM: No

Closure: This had some decent closure at the end, and I would call it a HEA ending. I did feel like some parts of it were unbelievable...

I first found this series when the sixth book The Golden Braid was on a kindle deal, and I just fell in love with it, and knew I had to read the rest of the series.  They are all very sweet clean fairy tale retellings, with great Christian themes throughout.  Melanie has fast become one of my favorite authors, I always look forward to reading more of her books.  My favorite book is The Merchant's Daughter which is the Beauty and the Beast retelling.  In fact I recommend starting with that one when first reading the series.  The first book, The Healer's Apprentice has some elements that are somewhat different from the rest of the series, it has to do with the bad guy plot, and I have been glad that I didn't start with that one.  All of these books are very good and enjoyable and fun.  This is a great way to get the first five books for a reasonable price, this is a better deal than buying the five books individually on kindle.

I have mixed feelings.  On one hand I enjoy fairy tale rewrites.  The writing portion of these books gets the stars.  The characters are developed and the story is well told withoutbeing obvious about the fairy tale.
Occasionally these stories were too wordy and could have used an editor.

What killed it for me though was the religion.  I'm a religious person and regularly read books with religious references and enjoy them.  The religion in these books was over the top and in many cases didn't fit into the story.  It felt weird and out of place.
And the last story in the collection was waaaaaaay to long. And I never figured out what fairy tale was being remade.  I don't know. Maybe the collection had lost my interest by then?

4053,3,A1AETUB8IPC1M2,B00L8A3BMK,"This was a cheesy romance book with a bit of religion slipped in, but it was cute. The synopsis, in my opinion, makes the book seem bland, but it wasnt. There aren't any hair-raising incidents or edge-of-your-seat issues, but it isn't boring.

Sarah Henley is a shy push-over that isn't aware of how easily controllable she is. She was an unique and interesting character and her point-of-view was refreshing. She enjoys writing, but shes allowed herself to try to get her Bachelor of Science instead of pursuing her dream, despite the fact that shes miserable. Her character development was done tastefully. Aiden pushed her out of her comfort zone because he was out of his comfort zone and she benefited from it. I liked watching her slowly step outside of her protective bubble more frequently as the book continued on, even though it obviously made her uncomfortable at the start. Shes a talented writer from the responses the other characters have made towards the things shes wrote, but she doesnt believe it due to a verbally abusive and manipulative boyfriend. I was really rooting for her by the time the book ended.

Aiden was a sweet, outgoing, guy that went from hugging Sarah to comfort her to needing comfort and back again. But not in a whiny way, it was more like Im staying strong, but if you're offering a hug, I need one. It was cute to watch him interact with Sarah and hold her hand as he coaxed her out of her extreme introverted ways. What I loved the most was that he wasn't her saving grace. He didn't just show up with perfect white teeth, ocean-like blue eyes, handsome golden hair, with rippling muscles, a cologne that smelled like pine and masculinity, and breath that always smelled like peppermint. He was a guy that was handsome but it wasn't overdone. He had flaws and fears and a heart that loves but still hurts from things in his past. I appreciated that his past wasn't some deep mysterious thing where he got kidnapped by some secret organization and had to kill everyone to get out. Instead, it was something real and raw that brought him down to earth and made him an even better love interest.

I wish they had developed their relationship a bit more, but the ending was smooth and it was tasteful; it wasn't abrupt or drawn out, so I won't gripe about it. The rest of the characters were necessary and added to the plot in their own ways which I noticed and appreciated. I loved that Aiden and Sarah met on an airplane and their friendship started off there. It reminded me of the book The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight by Jennifer E. Smith. The plot was adorable, especially the beginning when they were first meeting and it just continued to get cute from there, and thankfully, it stayed clean the whole way through. The most interesting part of the plot was that its set in South Africa.

With that said, there is also a lot of physical violence and there is repeated flashback of sexual abuse that may upset victims of child molestation/rape/and date rape. It is intertwined in the series and honestly I think the books could have been written with out the evil sub plot of sexual exploitation of the main characters.

There is romance, but there is so much victimization and horrible behavior that the book becomes really disturbing.

The last 15 pages of the final book ties everything up into a neat and tidy package and I find that really annoying. All the loose ends are tied together to make a semi plausible happy ending.

After everything you go through with the main characters I found the ending a bit of a slap in the face. The only thing it was missing was ""And They Lived Happily Ever After.""

The plot synopsis was intriguing - but the synopsis was the best part of all, it goes down hill from there.  The plot is never developed, the story is so shallow and unbelievable that it's amazing it ever got published.  The author tries to pull in so many twists and turns that you begin to roll your eyes.

I was expecting a full size book so I was a bit disappointed because I need a lot of help.  I also think the author going down to a size 4 in a relatively short period of time gives people false hope.  Going down to a size 4 to me means she wasn't really obese.  I am a size 12 and am not at all obese (overweight, yes!) and I don't see myself ever reaching a size 4 without looking like a skeleton.

It's just sloppy, story, characters, plot nothing was well written and interesting about this whatsoever and this person has no business writing erotica because just putting a few sexually explicit words down without trying to actually write anything remotely good is an insult to the reader and the only good thing about this was it was free but there are a lot of nicely written stories out there so don't waste your time with this one.",Not worth your time,2,10/12/2016

4066,4,ASQW8Y9DY6LM6,B00L9KO8LC,"Elmo Jenkins is a seminary student, and one the requirements for graduation is a six-month internship with a church. Ditched by his date at a fancy party, Elmo meets one of the ministers of the fabled First Church, and lands his internship.

First Churchs denomination isn't mentioned. It could be Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, or a similar group. If youve grown up within the boundaries of Protestant Christianity in the United States, the church is instantly recognizable  the megachurch with the big tall steeple usually located right in the middle of downtown.

Elmos office is (literally) a transformed broom closet in a large complex of offices. He begins to navigate his way through both the building and the churchs labyrinthine internal politics, politics that extend to the local business community, the seminary, and the country club. All-too-human frailties have to be dealt with. A minor 100-year-old mystery needs solving. And theres even the possibility of romance; actually, theres more than a possibility.

Ordained Irreverence is the first of four Elmo Jenkins novels and four novellas by McMillian Moody. Moody, who lives in Tennessee (where there are any number of First Churches to choose from), has taken a humorous yet rather fond look at institutions like First Church and the characters who inhabit them  the senior pastor, the trusted assistant pastor, the worship leader, and all the other people who comprise the staff of a large church.

Moodys intent isn't to poke fun and puncture balloons, but he clearly knows enough about churches to know that First Church isn't a completely fictional creation. What keeps the book from drifting into sarcasm is the understanding that, despite all the egos and foibles on display, Gods work is somehow getting done.

We can laugh at the inside church jokes and punctured egos, but Moody keeps returning us to the purpose of the church, and to the fact that even large churches, once you're past the glitter and theatrics, can serve good purposes. Elmo may be irreverent, but he knows what he and the church are called to do.","Humorous, fond look at big churches",7,9/15/2016

This is a sweet gothic romance. I was reminded of a cross between Jane Eyre and Beauty and the Beast, albeit with a modern twist.

I loved Rissa, even though she was almost too kind and perfect to be believed at times, the author still gave her a backbone and brains, which balanced her sweetness nicely. I loved the secondary characters and thought they were well done. Particularly the butler, whom I adored.

Liam's daughters were great, too. A lot of people don't enjoy children in romance novels, it has never bothered me, if done well, and here it is done perfectly. And Liam? Ooooh, Liam was yummy.

Completely alpha, but with this giant heart. I wanted to smack him more than once, but that only added to the tension. And the tension was superb, both sexually and and plot-wise. I raced through the last third like a mad woman.

Note, for those picky ones out there, there is a handful of formatting issues, and a smidgen of editing missteps, but they didn't detract from the story for me at all after the first couple pages.

I would highly recommend this story for all romance lovers. :)",Engrossing cross between Jane Eyre & Beauty and the Beast,3,2/10/2016

4075,3,A1PL4ITJMAIDRR,B00LAMR2TO,"The story, told in first person, is interesting. However, it doesn't resonate well with me as a Christian Romance, since there was no romance involved--hidden desires do not a romance make.

I loved that Michelle felt rewarded in doing what was best for her niece and nephew and could feel her anxiety about her sister's return, but the story was drawn out for no apparent reason since it ended at a place that was not really a cliff-hanger, nor would it entice to read any other books.

The writing--though a unique style--left a bit to be desired. There were many instances in which modifiers were misplaced in the sentences and i had to reread to get a better understanding of what was being said. At one point in the story, the action was taking place past March, but continued in February--not a year later, but the month before.

Like most of us Indie Authors, we could all benefit from another pair of eyes or even more, before publishing. I'm learning from my own work, it's not enough to have someone say a work was a great story.  We really need someone to tell us what's wrong so we can fix it.

4076,1,A2U7CRM1FZ0XIX,B00LAS4U48,"This book has quite a bit of information for a beginner to essential oils and even gives a history of them. I question the safety of this book for beginners because it glosses over extremely important safety information. It suggests applying essential oils EITHER pure or with a carrier oil. It's not a good idea to tell a beginner they can apply oils pure without proper warnings. There are too many oils that shouldn't be applied without a carrier, honestly, I was taught to never apply an oil without a carrier due to the extreme concentration of the oil, our body is not designed to take in as much as as concentrated oils would allow for.

This review went from a 3 star immediately to a 1 star rating as soon as I read the author advocate for ingesting essential oils. Please please please do not do this! It is extremely dangerous! Oils are extremely concentrated and just a couple of drops is like ingesting huge amounts of the plant it comes from. You can easily do harm to your body with just little bits. It is not safe, do not do it!  This information is not provided in this book and should be if this person really understands the safety and uses of essential oils.

Not that I have much respect for this book at this point anyway, but the author also advocates for using essential oils with infants. Do not do this! This is a harmful practice that was just glossed over in this book with minimal explanation.

The next part of this book goes over specific oils, their history, scientific names, etc. as well as different ailments and what the author states is a good oil for each. At this point I do not trust any of this information because there are already glaring issues with the advice of this author and I have no clue where this information was gathered and the research behind the authenticity and safety of it. If you have any health issues, please go to your doctor first and discuss different treatments, then find out advice from a medical professional about the oils you wish to use and ask if there are any reputable essential oil experts they can recommend. This book is not one of them.

Chapter 6 gives a brief overview of different ways oils are used in beauty products, but doesn't give much discussion on the topic.

Next the author gives resources for essential oils and the first highly recommended resource by the author is doTERRA so it becomes obvious to me immediately why there are so many issues with this book. doTERRA is known for providing faulty and harmful suggestions to their customers in order for them to ""consume"" their product faster so they can make more money. Repeatedly they have been called out by the FDA for this information and asked to remedy their practices. This is absolutely not a company or brand I trust and it speaks volumes to the type of information found in this eBook.

I do not recommend this book at all. If you are a beginner to essential oils please do not use this book. There are harmful suggestions found within.

There are formatting and editing problems, and this is an extremely short novel, but I enjoyed the creativity of the use of photos, images, and maps. The characters are quirky and likable, and the reader can get attached to them surprisingly quickly despite the more fantastical elements. In fact, I was charmed by how matter-of-factly the characters react to the aliens in their midst. There was no shock or horror at the difference, or even the surprising (and funny) news the aliens brought about Earth's place in the universe. This could have been developed more for its satirical possibilities. As it is, the author seems to be going for light entertainment, nothing deeper.

According to the way its advertised on Amazon, this is supposed to be a book for teens, but it seemed to head in a racy direction more than once, though nothing graphic occurs. It took away from the light, quirky adventure of it, I thought, but others might feel differently.

While Jillian takes a trip to Montana to visit her best friend, she ends up having a one night stand with Zack. She's hurt, though, when she wakes up the next morning and discovers Zack left without saying goodbye. So, she puts aside her feelings and flies back home. Months later, Jillian moves to Montana after news that her ex husband's wife is pregnant, something Jillian had been trying to achieve with her ex-husband for years. But while she's in Montana, she sees Zack again, and all the feelings come flooding back. But Zack has his own problems such as trying to take care of his teenage son after his ex-wife abandoned him, and trying to work through his PTSD after the war he fought in. But there's something about Jillian that helps soothe him and he can't seem to keep his hands off of her. Will a one night stand turn into something more?

This is the third book in a series, so while it isn't necessary to read the ones before this, it may help you better understand Jillian and Zack's relationship, because the one night stand happens in the first book, Loving Cara. I really liked Jillian's charactershe was quirky, fun and great around Zack's son, and I also liked Zack as a character because while he was often brooding, he was also kind and loving when it came to Jillian. There's a big misunderstanding between Jillian and Zack in the novel, which turns into a big fight, that I didn't think was necessary and it came across as unrealistic, which is one of the things I disliked about it. But the than that, I really enjoyed this one and am definitely going to read more novels by Kristen Proby.

How I let these amazing novels slip through the cracks is beyond me, but at least I got to it and fell in love! Where I Belong is the first book in the Alabama Summer series. Technically it can stand alone, but from what I am getting from the story and interconnected characters who have their own books, they should be read in order for better enjoyment. Tessa, for example, has her own book (the second book in the series) and readers will better understand her and her relationship by reading this one first. Plus, she plays a big role in this one so...

With that, this is EVERYTHING that I needed in a romance at the moment. It is a southern romance (taking place in Alabama, duh), and has a sweet talking alpha male who happens to be not only a COP (I have a thing for cops, luckily my husband is one or I would be in trouble), but a SINGLE DAD as well. Mmmmmm..... This book encompasses so many of my favorite things that I swooned upon learning all this. The heroine, Mia, is an independent SASS-HOLE. Is that a word? Doesn't matter. It is now. Anyway, she has a deep hatred for Ben (the hero) because he teased her relentlessly when they were younger. So when she decides to spend the summer with her BFF Tessa (also sister of Ben) she thinks he won't be around much because he is grown and has his own life. Unfortunately she is WRONG because he realizes what a jerk he used to be and will stop at nothing to make it up to her.

Overall, I LOVED THIS BOOK. I am definitely reading the next one in the series soon because I loved Tessa (and all her weirdness) and NEED her story now. I found everything about the story, the little twists at the end (which were emotional BTW) and everything in between to be PERFECT. This book has a great amount of humor (I laughed quite a few times), quite a bit of angst, and a whole lot of swoon worthy moments.

I had one-clicked this book when it was on sale and all I can say is that I'm so happy I FINALLY gave this one a chance!

There is no one Mia hates more than Ben Kelly. As her best friend's brother, all Ben did was torment and make fun of Mia growing up. Now, Mia is returning to Alabama to spend the summer with her childhood best friend and is determined to ignore Ben, no matter how many years have passed between them. Little does Mia know, the hot guy she meets at the bar and goes home with on her first night back in Alabama is none other than Ben Kelly. Ben never expected to fall for the Mia he liked to pick on as a kid, but she's a completely different person and he's determined to show her how different he's become too.

Oh my gosh, from the beginning I was a totally goner for Ben. When we learned about what he did as a job and more background information about his life (trying to not spoil anything here!), I was literally swooning over him. I loved so much, though, how Mia was definitely not making it easy for him, no matter how attracted to him she was now. It was so funny how they reconnected and how Mia was definitely not ready to forgive him for the mean things he did when they were kids.

There is another character in this book that I was OBSESSED with, but I can't say who that person is without spoiling something major. All I can say is that he was so gosh darn cute and I loved him. Other characters I loved were definitely Ben's sister and his coworker. I really enjoyed their little side-drama romance and definitely want to know more of their story. I wish we had gotten more of Tessa, though, since Mia had gone to Alabama to spend the summer with her. But I do understand how Mia and Ben had a growing relationship that had to take up the focus of the story.

Overall, I am so happy that I've finally read something by J Daniels. I am so excited to pick up her other books and fall even more in love with her writing and her characters!",Officially Obsessed with J Daniels!,3,9/2/2017

The push pull of these two had me riveted to the pages, So many times i had to fan myself with that dirty delicious mouth of Bens!! The chemistry leapt out of the pages and my emotions were entangled and hanging on edge. I loved every minute of getting to know this couple, and i loved the journey i made with them along the bumpy emotional path to their happy ever after.  Noah just stole my heart, as he will yours.  I wanted nothing more that this couple to make it, i wanted Mia to let go of her difficult past and see herself for the amazing girl she was. And i wanted Ben to win his Girl !!!  Simply put..

She decides since the friend is not a virgin, that she is going to hook up the night before in the friends hometown - she moved in HS to a different state. Meets a guy in a bar, GOES HOME with him, has 5 earth shattering orgasms and no apparent pain from having virginal sex with his 9"" dick, three times that night.
Next day leaves him still not exchanging names, and goes to the BFFs house. Only to find out that her BFFs brother who tormented her growing up, to the point that once she fasted for two days because of a comment, is the guy she hooked up with. How did either not realize this?
Sorry this is a 20% DNF for me and maybe a return.

4093,1,A1EWIR7XOV80CA,B00LD6IYUS,"Pass on this book!  The storyline and characters are so cliche and one dimensional.  The H was a bully to the h when they were kids.  Skip forward nine years.  Ben is a cop, has a child, and has random hookups, but he also gets oral sex from his ex, whom he supposedly can't stand?  My dream man!  Mia, takes care of her terminally ill mother,  doesn't work, so curious how they pay their bills?  Mia is going to spend the summer with her friend, Tessa, who happens to be Ben's sister, a sister who asks about her brother's penis size?  Really creepy!  Mia goes to a bar before going to Tessa's, to lose her virginity, because who wants to start a vacation still a virgin?  Guess who takes her home, neither asking or giving names?  Surprise the next day when they see each other at Tessa and Ben's parents house.  Seriously skimmed the entire book. Not sure why all the 4 & 5 star reviews.",Ridiculous characters and storyline,12,7/1/2017
4094,3,A3CP3ADDFF4CLI,B00LD6IYUS,"Mia, who's going to visit her best friend since forever, Tessa; decides that before she gets there, she needs to stop off and lose her virginity real quick first. That was ridiculous, I did not care for Mia in the beginning. I mean seriously?? Just stop at the nearest bar and the first guy that shows you attention, will do? That's gross....

Anyway, she meets a guy, he's hot, they hook up.... she's really forward for a virgin, she must have a repressed vixen inside of her cuz she wasn't acting like no virgin... which whatever, moving on... She slips out in the morning and goes to the best friends house. And BAM, comes face to face with Tessa's brother, Ben... who tortured her growing up with the cruelest things. I really felt for her, but....it hadn't been 25 years since she seen him, how did they not recognize each other? Even kids I went to elementry with and never saw again, I would know them if I saw them... that was a bit far fetched...

I also didn't like the banter between girls and then Tessa and her brother, it was all too young-adulty for me...which kills me to say, because I""m not old! But still.... amazeballs.... yuck.
Then everything with Ben's ex was so predictable and then she gets thrown in jail which worked great for the story but I was just like.... okay, well, of course it would get her out of the way so she could be Ben's son's new mommy.... that's exactly what happened too.

Now, in all that complaining that I just done... I did like Ben and his dirty mouth. I like the posessiveness and all that, even if it was after five minutes and all the sudden she was his angel. None of that bothered me, I dig hot guys with kids, so... I really liked him.
It was the rest I was unsure about...
I felt like Mia grew up towards the end though and I found myself rooting for them at the end.
Overall, a rocky start but a great ending.
I have a feeing Tessa is next and she irritated me too with the attitude and her banter with literally anyone. And seriously, her obsession with her brother's sex life and package was a little disturbing. Gross, actually. I don't even wanna think about how big any of my brothers are, I'd never ask my sister in laws about them.... gag....terrible mental image.

Anyway, not my favorite, but not bad either.",On the fence,3,6/25/2017

4096,4,A3HJXZ11XTFB0E,B00LD6IYUS,"I am a sucker for those second chance relationships but this really isn't a second chance ... it is more of a bully turned nice guy who finally sees the beautiful girl he was so mean to.

I enjoyed Mia and her transformation... how she moved away and grew, was taking care of her mother and went back to visit her friend for the summer.

I enjoyed that Ben was a bully but grew up and became a man. A single dad police officer man! A sweet man who sets his sights on Mia and knows he wants her forever.

This book has a lot of sex. Like I skimmed a few scenes. I get it. They are hot for one another. But it made the plot more lacking then I would have liked it to be ... like right after being shot? On the side of the road? Um, no.

Mia's story did not add up in my eyes. Why the heck does she do with herself? I mean she grew up with Tessa but now loves 4 hours away with her mom - who is ill and under treatment for breast cancer - but doesn't have a job? She doesn't go to school? I was a little confused. I mean, she was suppose to be early 20s right?

Tessa is a spunky bestie that I see has her own book, which yes, I want to read but she is so SEX driven she talks about her brothers 9 incher. Um, what? That was a bit much ...

Things I LOVED:
- Mia was never infatuated with Ben. I loved that she was completely devastated when she discovered who he was.
- Nolan. He was a sweet side character :)
- Ben was completely taken by Mia, there was no bad guy or man whore, he realized who she was and just wanted her to fall for him.
- Tessa and Mia are super best friends. I love those that have an awesome bestie.
- They wait and say I Love You to each other faces, it was very sweet and I teared up!

4097,4,A1OLI68H9CPJLW,B00LD6IYUS,"4 stars!

I have to say, this turned out totally different than what I had in my mind, in a good way. It was sweet and cute and it did have a good history to back it up, I really really liked it.

Kids can be cruel, whether they are aware of it or not, words can hurt more than actions and Mias childhood nightmare was her best friends brother, Ben. Ben was simply put a jackass and he treated her like crap when they were kids and Mia is still not over it, understandably so, she was a chubby kid and Ben made fun of her a lot. No one likes to be made fun of, so Mia is still holding a grunge.

At first I didn't like Ben as much because he easily got into Mias looks  a huge contrast to what teen Ben treated her like  and I got the feeling that if Mia wasn't hot he wouldnt be as hell bend to get her to forgive him but over the course of the story he really understood how much words can hurt and he genuinely wanted to make it up to her; sometimes kids can be mean for no reason, sad but true. I don't know, that part was really weird for me but he turned out to be a good guy in the end.

Mia really did give him a hard time even when he went all caveman on her, she really stood her ground and I loved it, it was refreshing to have a heroine like that, plus Ben is kinda swoony, plus they are so freaking cute together and Ben, oh boy the mouth on that man, he is hot and they were explosive together.",Sweet and cute!,4,6/16/2017
4098,4,AL4D6OHMS2Z9P,B00LD6IYUS,"Ben Kelly meets the vision of his dreams and becomes obsessed with her....only to find out she wants nothing to do with him.  WTH?  I mean, all girls drool over him...so what gives?  It's massive payback for all the humiliation Mia Corelli endured from Ben's hateful teasing form their childhood.  Mia is Ben's sister's, (Tessa) best friend and for five grueling years, he put Mia through daily hell...making her cry, making her feel inadequate and insignificant as only immature teenage boys can.  Mia has never forgotten and certainly has never forgiven.  So when she comes back to her childhood home after being gone for 9 years, she nor Ben recognize one another when they hook-up.

24 y/o Mia Corelli is a stunning beauty.  When she decides to give up her V-card to a stranger in a bar at her old hometown she's visiting, she never dreamt it would turn out to be the butt she longed to never see again.  Her arch enemy.  And as for Ben, payback sucks.  The girl he once couldn't get far enough away from, is now the woman he can't get close enough to.

This was a highly entertaining and humorous, fast paced, sweet story.  Witty dialogue told in 1st person with dual POV's.  Erotic steam, explicit adult language and weak, but good controversy.  The downside is the three problems facing Ben and Mia that are resolved too quickly.  She has such a hate for him and it was great watching what she puts him through...but he's forgiven rather quickly for how much she loathed him.  The problem of her living in Georgia and falling for a guy in Alabama is another issue that could've been prolonged...but again, problem is eliminated too quickly.  The problem of Ben's ex not giving him joint custody of his toddler son could've been a great dramatic issue had it been drawn out...but...it's resolved within a few paragraphs.  It was a great build up to a big let down.  I was disappointed with no angst, no turmoil, weak controversy and weak drama.  Everything was wrapped up and concluded rather sweetly and succinctly without much ado.  However the story line is told well and conveyed perfectly with a solid lead in to the next installment and it was fun, entertaining fluff; therefore I think it's deserving of four stars.",Fast paced and sweet....,7,6/11/2017
4099,5,A2JS9W6L30NL7T,B00LD6IYUS,"An enemy turned lovers romance. Some humor. Plenty of sex. A few teary eyed moments as well. Well played cast of characters (that lead us into the next book in the series,) though can be read as a stand alone. Keeps you engrossed in the story. Reads easy and moves along quickly.

SPOILER ALERT: There were a couple things that bothered me though... after her mother dies, she finds out the man she loves got shot, and she immediately leaves to go to him. I guess I find it hard to believe she'd leave what appeared to be less than an hour after you're mother's death you'd rush off like that. Especially after you just got done beating yourself up because you weren't there for her when she got sick. Plus it only mentioned that the aunt was going to take care of everything, but never mentioned going back for the funeral or anything. After all the talk about leaving mom for the summer, and all the guilt she felt, I felt her actions were a bit unbelievable. I know she was dead, (and her boyfriend of a month had been shot and she was worried) but it didn't really show her grieving.

But other than that one complaint, I really liked and enjoyed the story and look forward to reading more of the series.",Reads easy and moves along quickly,9,3/15/2017

Some of my friends had suggested her books and I was at the fence about starting a new to me author. I'm glad they pushed this recommendation, but with this book, it's official. Hook. Line. Sinker. I need more.

Where I Belong is the first in the Alabama Summer series and it starts with Ben and Mia. Two people who could not stand each other when kids. He teased and picked on her turning her feelings to hate for him. But that was years ago. People change, right? Feelings do too, right?

I love Ben and Mia so much. The opening was HOT as heck and it continues throughout the book. I also love the supporting characters that are already creating a scene for upcoming books. I love the easy and accepting relationships between friends and siblings. This series has caught my attention so well that midway in this book I was anxious to start the next one to see what happens.

As my friends recommended this author, I feel compelled to say the same as them, ""Read and you'll thank me later."" I mean, who doesn't love a alpha, inked, dirty talking cop? Do I have your attention now?

Where I Belong is the story of Mia and Ben. Mia and Ben knew each other as kids thanks to Mia being best friends with Bens sister, Tessa. Ben was not very nice to Mia and his words and actions left an lasting impression on her.  Years after leaving Alabama, Mia has returned to spend the summer with her best friend.

Where I Belong hooked me from the moment I started reading it. Mia and Ben's dual points of view were perfect. I also loved the enemies to lovers theme in it -- especially since Mia unsuspectingly hooks up with her nemesis and gives him her virginity. It made for all sorts of fun -- and awkward -- moments.

I loved Mia and have great things to say about her character, but Ben really stole the show in Where I Belong. He was that in tune with his feelings guy that all of us girls dream of. Ben knew what he wanted and wasn't afraid to put himself out there to get it. He pursued Mia with a cockiness and force that I loved. Ben made the book for me. Well, Ben and then his chemistry with Mia. This book was so dang hot, people!

I truly loved Where I Belong. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for some craziness toward the end. I couldn't wrap my head around one of Mia's responses. Her actions surprised me, and I wasn't sure if I liked how she handled something. When it came down to it, the unexpected twist didn't ruin my reading experience.

I enjoyed her writing style and her voice even if I didn't always enjoy the book. I was left wanting more from this book a lot. I wanted to know more about Mia other than that her mom was sick and she was awkward as a kid. I also felt like I needed to suspend a lot of belief to enjoy this book, which I really didn't mind, but I know that it will bother other people.

Ben seemed like a really great guy. I wanted to know why he was such a jerk when they were younger. It felt like there was more behind his problem with Mia, but that was never explored. I couldn't put the book down. I did enjoy it a lot and would have enjoyed it even more if some of the things I wished had been explored had been explored. Also, I was a bit confused by how Mia reacted to a hugely tragic event in her life. I would have been beyond consolable, but she barely seemed fazed.

Ben has grown up and now is a responsible father and cop and sets out to prove himself to Mia because he knows that she is it for him. Lots of laughs, a few tears, and lots of heat accompany this great story of a forever love between former enemies.

Our hero, Harry, writes this very funny book in dairy style, just like Adrian Mole. He is also a bit of a wishy-washy character, again like Adrian Mole. The book is not quite as clever and subtly funny as the Adrian Mole diaries. It outlines a year in the daily life of Harry and Emily, with their first child, and their first marriage problems. Many readers will recognise their own tribulations of that first year with a new baby! I really enjoyed the book and Jon Rance is a very good writer.

Since she was a child, Kelli always had a deep crush on Sheri's older brother Mac, but even now, with his mysterious background and gorgeous good looks, he didn't even know she existed.  As Sheri explained that Mac needed a fake-fianc&eacute; for a special but highly sensitive mission in Mexico, it didn't take but a second to accept her proposal, besides it was about time to have a little fun with the infamous Mac Patton.  Wasn't it?  Former marine and black ops expert MacArthur ""Mac"" Patton, couldn't believe how beautiful Kelli Landers was.  She was Sheri's best friend?  He always knew her, of course, but he never really noticed her either, that is until now.  With his work being top secret, dealing with government contracts and black op missions, it was imperative that he find a woman to pose as his fiance, to infiltrate and buy deadly units from a notorious arms dealer in Mexico, and Kelli was just the woman to make that happen.  As much as he tried to explain the situation to her, Mac was not only stunned by her beauty but his reaction to her.  In his life, there was no room for relationships, attachments or the crazy notion of love, and most of all, he liked his life just the way it was, no bother, no fuss.  But as much as he tried to remain focused with the job at hand, he wasn't prepared for Kelli's constant flirting.  He thought Sheri sent him someone sweet, caring who could take orders, instead he was sent a seductive vixen, making him crazy with desire and he couldn't control his strong physical attraction for her, anymore than he could control a tidal wave.

But sometimes great charm in worldbuilding (those butter churns!) meets complex, interesting, unusual characterization and also beautiful style and then it can be magic. For me, Blackwoods trilogy is right up there with the Middle Grade stories of Diana Wynne Jones, and I don't say that very often.

Okay, so, Im sure lots of you have already read the first two books, but let me see if I can do this without significant spoilers.

The first book of this MG trilogy, Jinx, is self-contained, but you may be aware that the second, Jinxs Magic, is not. It feeds directly into the third book of the trilogy, Jinxs Fire.

Because the third book is continuing the story established earlier, Jinx and the whole Urwald already face a clear threat, a complicated problem that needs to be solved before they have much chance of dealing with the threat, and a ton of relationships that need to be worked out among the various characters.

Well, there are three different threats, actually. At least three. And several different complicated problems. And, yes, a ton of complicated relationships.

Although the Bonemaster is one Seriously Creepy Villain  hell suck out your soul with a straw, you know, and stack up your bones criss-cross  in some ways the threat he poses is not as great as the more fundamental threat posed by possible invasion from outside the Urwald. I mean, the Bonemaster belongs to the Urwald. Hed hardly want to see the forest completely destroyed. That isn't the case for outside invaders who see the forest as a great source of lumber, and valuable land once its cleared. So Jinx and Elfwyn and everyone sure have their job cut out for them.

Similarly, although the problem of getting Simons soul back is a big deal, the more serious problem is the gradual disappearance of the Urwalds intrinsic magic, and in order to deal with either problem, Jinx, or someone, really needs to figure out how the Urwalds magic actually works.

And all the way through, the characters have to grow up and/or work out their relationships; such a pleasure to spend time with them all.

Elfwyn really grew up in this story. She started out with such a typical fairy-tale problem: how to get rid of this annoying curse. Then Blackwood takes Elfwyn and her curse in such an unexpected direction. I love Elfwyns determination and her willingness to take responsibility for things and put herself in peril. Honestly, she seems like perhaps the most clear-sighted character in the whole trilogy. The relationship between Jinx and Elfwyn is really well done, though personally I don't feel the trace of potential romance was actually necessary. The key relationship for me is the one between Jinx and Simon.

I think maybe I have a particular fondness for really well-drawn father figures, and Simon is possibly my favorite character in the trilogy. He is such a total jerk in some ways, especially at first, and then eventually does the right thing almost despite himself. Hes complicated  a little bit evil, but not really. Hes irascible and snappish and touchy and has a horrible relationship with his own father and keeps a zillion cats and oh yes is married to a sensible scholarly woman from another world. The relationship between Jinx and Simon is what hooked me in the first place and I loved seeing them together again in this book.

Jinx is grumpy and impatient in this book, and one does wonder how much of that attitude he learned from Simon and how much is just him. In some ways hes been growing into himself over the course of this trilogy, becoming more confident. In other ways, he is resisting his own gifts as hard as he can. I will say, his persistent hesitation to use his particular brand of magic to deal with the invasion practically drove me mad. Its not that I don't get his hesitation, but Id have been right there with everyone else shouting at him to go on and get it done. I do think Blackwood kind of elided the carnage wed really see in that kind of situation, thus allowing Jinx to drag his feet a bit longer than I think was reasonable. On the other hand, this is a MG story, not a bloody tour through war and the brutality attendant on conquest, so probably it was a good idea to pass lightly over the less fairy-tale aspects of the invasion.

In the end, the resolution of the story solidly shuts the door on all the various threats facing the Urwald  or at least the urgent threats. Not quite the traditional happily-ever-after, the ending nevertheless brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion. Overall, an engrossing story involving characters who virtually step off the page, set in a beautifully drawn fairy-tale world. An excellent choice for an advanced MG reader or for an adult who enjoys really well-written MG stories, I think this trilogy is going to be collecting new fans of all ages for a long time to come.",But sometimes great charm in worldbuilding (those butter churns,2,1/14/2016

Sidney is an undeniable force. Her voice is so strong and fun. Her anger management is hilarious. The way she struggles and yells at herself to behave, the peanut butter cup addiction, her habit of violent tantrums and throwing things. Its epic comedy. Shes adorably flustered.

Secondary characters are all memorable, funny, playful, and youll want more of all of them. The twins are devious little minxes, the McAllister triplets are devilish counterparts that always have something up their sleeves, and grams is the pervy elderly lady with absolutely no filter. Its wonderful how these characters interact and tease each other. The energy between them is fantastic and addictive. It will make you want to go out and have a spontaneous adventure.

Scenes are childish but comical. The rage and retaliation is awesomely immature. Tossing each other into the pool, shooting each other with paint balls, throwing food, its definitely engaging and will leave you laughing out loud for a long time.

CONS:

The sexual tension, when it was there, was fantastic. But it was so spaced out and thrown in with a bunch of random distractions that it took away from the chemistry. Most of the actual romance (read lust) culminated well after 80% of the book. For a story that is over 360 pages, this was a long,
long wait for anything to actually happen.

WHY Sidney cant be with Simon is BEYOND me. Theres just not enough, that critical betrayal scene wasn't potent enough to reinforce 10 YEARS of hatred and loathing. That introductory scene, the foundation for everything, was fast and convoluted and there was so much packed into it that it was hard to follow everything. So much was left unsaid that the relationship between Simon and Sidney all those years ago never felt as solid as it should have for her to be head over heels for the guy.

4143,4,A3U9B6GM4HZCBQ,B00LI485VI,"I had never read anything by this author at the time the book was offered for free (back in September 2014). Even then I wasn't sure if I wanted to read it because of all the controversy in the reviews about whether or not the hero cheated on the heroine. Some explained the cheating scene in such detail (actual penetration and thrusting, though no climax) that I just couldn't understand how there could be any confusion, because if the scene really played out like that then he definitely had to have cheated on the heroine. But since no one seemed to be able to agree on it and the book was free I thought I would give it a try. So glad I did, because in the version I read the hero was tied down to the bed and planned to go through with it but when the woman involved attempted to straddle him to engage in sex his bear freaked out and he got away. After that he changed the laws so that would never be an issue again. Some people may still consider that a form of cheating because he did in fact intend to go through with it, but in the end there was absolutely no penetrative sex, fondling, kissing or intimacy of any kind involved in the reworked version of the story.

So I asked myself, how could so many reviews claim in extremely specific detail, obviously read directly from their e-book versions, that it did happen? I think I received my answer when I read a comment left by a reader:

SouthernSky
""I can confirm that when I read it, she (the author) had completely changed the scene. She said she never meant for people to believe that he's a cheater so she changed it completely. He shifts before she gets the chance to basically force herself on him.""

So if you are a person like myself who just can't tolerate any cheating in a romance and are not sure whether to give this book a chance I would highly recommend it as long as you read the version published AFTER August 2014. Since this book I have gone on to read all of her series and quite enjoy the stories.

4144,1,A2KY76HK8DYRL3,B00LI485VI,"I've enjoyed several of the TS Joyce's stories but have found they are either highly entertaining or monumentally awful.  Unfortunately, this story falls into the awful category.  I think I know what the author was trying to accomplish but this was an epic fail, so spoilers to follow.  To get it out of the way first, since apparently it's highly controversial, there is in fact, cheating in this book.  Our Hero doesn't want to have sex with the another woman, but due to his traditions, he does in fact AGREE to have sex with another woman, brings condoms for the event, gets a hard on, and has sex.  He, during the act, grabs onto said woman's hips to pull her down for two more thrusts to finish the act and just because he doesn't get to climax, doesn't mean he didn't have sex willingly with another woman. Being tied up, which he agreed to, doesn't make it rape which is where I think the author was trying to go.  The whole scene was just downright nasty and quite frankly, the author should not advertise ""no cheating and monogamous shifter romance,"" when the Hero does in fact have sex with another woman, whether his heart is in it or not, he certainly did not say NO, does say yes, and admits it to his mate after the fact that he did in fact go through with having sex.  The author should consider rewriting it altogether so that this book doesn't put off future readers because if I had only this book to go on, I wouldn't read another one of her stories.

Now that that is out of the way, Hannah is in the witness protection program and testified against the man who killed her family.  The police are no help since they're apparently tipping off everywhere she goes.  unbeknownst to her though, she's being protected by a bear shifter, so when things get as bad as possible, Hannah is tucked away in a commune of bear shifters where she meets her mate.  Benson Riker is the alpha of his bear clan and he must find a mate.  He basically has the loveless match picked out when Hannah stumbles into his life.  From there, he's bound by tradition to follow the laws of his people in participating in a sex off to determine which woman his bear chooses.  Once that drama is over with, he must then figure out how to protect his mate from the relentless criminals tracking her down.

I understand this is a paranormal shifter romance so belief is already suspended, but the author could have tried to make this somewhat believable.  When Hannah shows up at the shifter compound, she's been shot, THREE TIMES, in the chest and has been patched up by a veterinarian and yet she's manhandled, has sex, and falls in love within 24 hours of her arrival. Really? And in anti-stereotypical fashion, an Alpha bear shifter decides to use his mate as bait to catch bad guys and turns her back over to killers, but for some reason they don't just shoot her dead, even though that's their only mission.  She has no information they need, she just needs to stop breathing, but they keep her around just long enough to be rescued.  Really?  I was actually snorting out loud at some of these antics.  Unfortunately, this first installment has killed the series for me, but I would recommend the Saw Bears, Fire Bears and the Gray Back Bear series since those were really cute and truly monogamous without mortal humans surviving impossible odds.","Don't believe the description, The hero does have sex with another woman",8,2/3/2016

 The lead biker is a dick, right to the end. That's it. He has few redeeming qualities.  Chauvinistic, arrogant,  simplistic in the I am me, is what I do and you're going to love it because I am me, sort of way. But, shows little to hold up and say yeah he's all those things but he has.....whatever going for him.
The female lead does have SOME things in her favor, she is bright and likeable, but, not loveable. She doesn't put up much of a fight when Ryker just steamrolled over her and tells her what she will do with little or no fight.  Gah!!!
 The other characters  are lackluster at best.
 What I did like is not a lot of flowery detail, about what the interior of each and every room and house and street and view... You get where I'm coming from here, right?  Sadly, there doesn't appear to much much else either. That is sad, cos the story is classic and in my opinion. (Who we kidding this is ALL just my opinion ) that just never gets old.

Now, this was a very cool book.  I cannot wait to read more of this series. It's funny and a deliciously sexy read that it perfect for an afternoon or a leisurely read over the weekend.

Set in Hell, TX this club has a run on biblical/sinful humor. From the bar with Think on your sins as the slogan to the panties strung around the bar to the quotes of Revelations in the boardroom and the mechanic shop run by one of the brothers it has lots of lighthearted little jokes and names in here. Also, the mom is a huge Queen fan as you will learn.

When Elizabeth walks into a biker bar looking like cotton candy she has all the bijers' heads turning. Ryker is going to get to know her though, at least Ling enough to seduce her. She is crying over being made fun of by her friend, Lisa, who has put her in this awful dress. Ryker is determined to get her drunk just not drunk enough to do mess up his plans but she plays him in pool and by play I mean that both ways.

She is a good girl though and he hasn't had a good girl. Lots of bad girls but not good girls. After they hit it off she has one trying to scare her away, one wanting to know what her intentions are and she hasn't decided herself yet.

When she has a stalker Ryker wants to end that real quick but she wants him to let her handle it. She tries but it's not working for her.  After a scary scene where she works she goes to tell Ryker about it but finds him with two other women like a ""vertical threesome"" on the dance floor. She's going to leave but his mom steps in to help her along the way to teaching Ryker a lesson.

Ryker is learning her going to spend a good bit of his time in trouble with her and she is enjoying herself a little too much at his expense.

I enjoyed this story, Ryker a bad azz biker and the librarian, ""Pinkie"", so named because she showed up at the Perdiditon bar in pink fluff after watching her ex boyfriend marry her best friend. No wonder she's stopped in for a drink. And because she's not the usual  'customer' at a biker bar, Elizabeth has caught the attention of more than just Ryker.  This is a fairly light hearted story of healing hearts, intense sex and love that results. I loved Rykers mother and how she takes charge in some situations.  While this book ends with an opening for the next one, its not a cliffhanger, which I totally appreciate. Characters introduced in this book evidently are the stars of subsequent books.

4176,4,A1III6USD7WRI3,B00LJVW62O,"For today, I read a biography about Walt Disney. He was born to a poor but hardworking family in 1901. When Walt was young his family lived and worked on a modest farm in Kansas. When he was 7, his parents enrolled both Walt and his younger sister in school together. While he didn't mind waiting the extra 2 years before starting school (he really had no interest in education), like most kids he didn't enjoy being in the same grade as his little sister.

Early on Walt developed an interest in the performing arts. He auditioned for and won the role of Peter Pan in a school play. He also taught himself how to draw successive images to create a flip book (basic animation) and began to develop an interest in becoming an artist. It was an interest that would someday take him to great places.

When the family farm failed, Walt's family moved to Kansas City. Their father took a job delivering newspapers. With several thousand newspapers to deliver every day, Walt and his brother Roy were put to work helping their father deliver papers every morning. All their lives, hard work was one constant that they were familiar with. Growing up with such a willingness to work hard would be one of his strongest assets and would help to take Walt to a wonderful future.

When Walt was in high school, the family moved back to Chicago. Again, hard work was still a constant in their lives with the boys often working multiple jobs when they could find the extra work. In 1918, at the age of 16 and with the help of his mother, Walt enlisted in the Red Cross Ambulance Corps. But it wasn't until after the end of the war that he was sent to France to deliver relief supplies. There, he often used his artistic abilities to earn himself some extra cash.

When he returned to Chicago he took a job in a commercial art studio where he met first Ubbe Iwerks. In 1920 the two young men formed Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. The partnership didn't last long at this point (though they would often work together again in the future), but it brought Walt to his first job creating animated shorts that ran in local theaters. Walt learned all he could, and as his skills improved, it led from the one job to others.

Walt began making quite a name for himself over the years. He started working with his brother Roy who focused more on the business they were growing whereas Walt was the creative force. It was a partnership that would work well for them and one that would continue during their lifetimes.

Walt & Roy moved to Hollywood, where they continued to learn and practice their craft of filmmaking. During this time, Walt would meet the love of his life, Lillian Bounds and the two were soon married. Although they desperately wanted to start a family, it would be some time and several miscarriages before Lillian finally gave birth to a daughter. Once he became famous enough that people began to recognize him wherever he went, Walt would do his best to keep his family out of the spotlight, having seen what can happen to the children of famous people in the world. (For those familiar with the story of the Lindburg baby, it was an example of what could happen and a good reason for him to keep his family out of the spotlight and his private life, private.)

After losing the rights to his main animated character Oswald, Walt Disney would ever afterwards be careful to retain control of his creations. It was a painful lesson, but one that would serve the Disney brothers well in later years.

Walt's next character would become his most famous and endearing: Mickey Mouse. He originally planned on naming him Mortimer Mouse, but Walts wife convinced him that the name Mortimer was too pompous sounding and suggested that he call the character Mickey Mouse instead.

Over the years they would continue to grow and expand, creating many new innovations and techniques that drastically improved filming of both live action and animated shorts until Walt felt it was time to make a full length animated film. Many would refer to it as ""Disney's Folly"" believing that no one would want to sit through a 90 minute animated film. That film, whose actual title was Snow White, went on to be the highest-grossing motion picture of 1938 and earned Walt Disney a number of awards. It also proved that audiences truly did enjoy full length animated films just as much as they did live action films. It was only the first of many feature animated films that Disney would go on to create.

There is so much more that I could say about Walt Disney, his life, and his family, but this entry is already becoming far too long. I have yet to get to so many of his other innovations and accomplishments, not the least of which includes what is often referred to as the Happiest Place on Earth: Disney World. He was a amazing man who lived a fascinating life. He did not always succeed in his goals, but he never gave up trying to achieve and accomplish more. He was one of the first who saw the value in creating a television show as a means of promoting his brand. Today, his name is one of the most recognizable names anywhere Ask anyone, and I doubt you would be able to find a single person who has not heard of Walt Disney. Ask any child about Disney World, and you will likely find a child who is begging a parent to take them to the park on their next family vacation.

I highly recommend reading this book to learn more about Walt Disney and his life, as honestly I have only managed to barely touch on it here. There is still so much more to learn about him. I know I enjoyed reading it and had a very hard time putting the book the down at night. My daughter was amazed at how quickly I finished reading it. Take a look at it for yourself.

Let me use this review to get on my soap box and preach about the amazingness that is Goodreads. A lot of people talk crap about this website and how it's only haters on there. I disagree. This website has helped me discover so many new authors and books that I would have never heard of before.

Case in point? This book. If I had not seen this 8 word review by a friend, I would not have read this book. I would have no clue this book existed. So thank you Supreet for your short review!!([...])

Anyways, this book is a trope I love, where the girl gets pregnant, the guy leaves her but then comes back wanting forgiveness. I felt this book was very well done, I didn't see either parent making bad decisions once dad came back in the picture, everything that was done was done with the intention for what was best for the child. No keeping the kid from one parent or using her for advantages. Both parents had the child in mind.

It's also so wonderfully angsty!!!! Omg, I ate it up! I do wish Paige had made Mitch work for forgiveness a little bit more, because I am a huge fan of groveling.

It was fun to picture the characters from the show although the book description didn't always match the tv character.

4199,4,A112JRLN4F6ZYQ,B00LLSZDOI,"This book is interesting and the mystery is unusual. However, the story would probably appeal more to readers familiar with the series due to the fact that so much of the drama involves events and people who appear in prior books. I am not sure that new readers will be properly invested in the numerous events that are extraneous, or only strenuously connected, to the primary mystery. Indeed, one of the primary mysteries involves the murder of a person who was pivotal in two earlier books and the fallout of that murder affects the main characters personally based on, in part, emotional and traumatic events that occurred in earlier novels. So much that happens in this book involves facts, characters, and events that appear and are fully explained before Hot Lava even starts. I personally started reading this series in the middle and was very disappointed in the book that I read first (Shattered Palms) due to how much of that story was based on important past history that was not adequately explained.

However, for readers of the series, the events pack a powerful punch. Indeed, the first crime presented in the book seems a little underwhelming given all of the turmoil occurring in Lei and Michael's lives. That turmoil is what grabs readers' emotions and real interest in my opinion.

I did have a few criticisms, mainly related to continuity issues. I can't describe many of the problems since it would reveal spoilers, but one example relates to whether a character was murdered given the lack of needle marks on her body, but that character was on a morphine drip so injecting a poison or an overdose could have easily been accomplished by injecting it into the IV tubing. In addition, some events and thoughts feel superficially facile. None of these detract substantially from the main action, but they create irritating little jabs to the story.

The main character was a generic mish-mash of urban fantasy characteristics but without a real personality.  There were times that I felt like I'd missed another book somewhere because it felt like the reader was supposed to already know things about the characters, but it turns out that the author just didn't want to explain them.

None of the secondary cast of characters had a personality.  The romantic interest was as deep as a puddle, but at least he was hot, which is all that matters.  Right?  And it seemed that the author really had no idea of what a succubus was, or was attempting to put a unique spin on her that didn't really make sense.  The lead character's ability-pool just felt random, like she could do whatever the author wanted into order to advance the story along.  Except sometimes, it didn't even help do that.

Now I further disagree that he claims that God is one person instead of the Triune God of the Scriptures.  He gives a whole lot of scriptures which don't illustrate his point nor does he break these scriptures down (exegesis) to explain a point.  He does not go back to the original languages from the Greek and Hebrew such as is found in Strong's Exhaustive Concordance (which shows you every word in the bible and where it is found and a numerical listing to that word in the Greek or Hebrew dictionary in the back of this marvelous textbook).

Now the author admits to consuming large quantities of alcohol and and a lot of his writing seems to come from a drunken experience.

Wish I had known this when I first read the trilogy that was available as a inducement purchase at $0.99 for 3.  At this point, for how cheap the books have been, I have hung in there and have gotten through book 12.  Story starts out interestingly enough, but by this book (5), it was clear the author started to phone it in at some points.  So help me if I have to hear how the main character was banished in the first place, why he is better with his staff (giggle, giggle) than most knights are with a sword, how he got his new staff and it's magical prowess (more giggling).  Seriously, by book 5 all the readers are aware of the prowess of his staff and don't need all the page filling backstory ad nauseam.  Author could get rid of some of the repetitive fight moves that seem to riddle the series.  As for the setting of the series, a few different creature types are available outside of the standard elves, goblins, orcs of Middle Earth and they are descriptively written and well developed.  Overall, I'm through book 11 at this point and it's entertaining enough to hang in there to see how the good guys will win.  And on the plus side, the author churns them out quickly, so there is not a great deal of lag time between installments.  I believe book 12 is available now.  You could wait until 2017 and read them all through at once as the author's projected timeline for completion is the end of 2017.

4220,4,A15KCWF3PW7PQM,B00LOTFY1Q,"I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for a voluntary and honest review.

I waffled on what to rate this book as there were parts of this book that I found myself really liking and laughing about, while other parts were not very believable and I just wanted to get through them as fast as possible.  There were also multiple things missed by the author, editor and proof readers.  By habit I find myself marking (highlighting and bookmarking) all the issues I find if they start to seem prevalent in a book.  I didn't start marking this book until the second part and had approximately 60 bookmarks when finished, fortunately the majority were missing spaces and extra periods and only a few were incorrect grammar so hopefully as a reader you won't find it too disturbing.

Now about the story ... There are a few main players; Gabriel aka ""Gabe"" Gregory, Stelly Mulroney, her best friend Veronica aka ""Ronnie"", Gabe's evil dad Arnie, and Stella's evil stepfather Mitch.  Arnie owns and heads ups a law firm that specializes in handling celebrity scandels, as well as being partners with Mitch in a couple of private sex clubs in London and New York.  Gabe is a top lawyer for his dad's firm and has an opening for a Personal Assistant (PA).

Stella resents her stepfather for sabotaging her relationship with her mother after her father died, sending her away to boarding school where they didn't have any real contact and for continuing to limit and interfer with potential relationship they could build today.  She knows that her stepfather is a client of Arnie Gregory's lawfirm and has spent the last two years applying for a position, so she can try and find some ""dirt"" and destroy him.  Stella meets Gabe when she interviews for his open PA position, but thinks it is actually one for her father.  During the course of the interview, it becomes apparent that Gabe has done his homework and knows that there is some reason she wants to work there besides just the job as his assistant.  Stella decides to come clean about her plans to ruin her stepfather and prepares to leave thinking that there is no way she would be hired now that she has confessed.  Gabe lets her know that he has his own ""daddy"" issues and if they work together he might be able to help her get what she wants and take down his father as well.

Throughout their interactions there was a ""sexual tension"" and flirting, so part of what Gabe explains to Stella is about their father's partnership in the sex clubs that she wasn't aware of and she blushes, just as she has done everytime they have flirted or he has gotten two close.  He explains that she has quite a few innocent type of traits that will get her eaten alive if continued so he offers to educate her through The Alphabet Game.  This is a game he invented with her in mind that would provide a new sexual experience based upon the next letter of the alphabet, starting with the letter ""A"" for arousal.

The book itself is split into four parts, but is not a serial which I appreciated.  There are a few twists, turns and a couple of things that were expected and unexpected.  Some of the sexual scenes were described in pretty good detail, while some were not and used some repetitive verbage.  I was hoping for a little more erotic / explicit descriptions, especially after learning what the game was about, but I did learn a few new terms.

All in all I did like the book and highly recommend it.  I will be quickly adding the next story to my reading list as I want more of the sass Ronnie provided and her story is next.","Highly recommended, had some twists & turns but could have provided more erotic descriptions within concept of the game",3,2/20/2017

Even the secondary characters. I am glad some of them will get their own story. There are, however, I few things I did not like. First of all, the story started out very slow. There were pages upon pages were nothing happened and I started skipping over a few to find the place were the story continued. Not until chapter 34 did the pace pick up. Secondly, a few things seem impossible to believe. One example would be that three people dumped in the pit take off their armor to warm each other, start freezing and turning numb anyway, and are then able to easily climb a rope, put their armor back on and take up their swords. How did they climb so easily with frozen hands, how did the armor get up from the pit, and how did they get a hold of swords? They were after all in the dungeons with only three guards. The third thing that truly annoyed me were the numerous typos and grammatical mistakes. That was very distracting. I am giving this book 3 1/2 stars.

I truly enjoyed this story, and look forward to reading more by this author, and hope to see many of the characters featured as heroes and heroines in their own novels.

There was a perfect balance of sympathetic characters, action, and emotion that left me wanting more. I was pulled into every scene and felt as though I were right in the midst of the action.

The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is due to multiple grammatical mistakes, particularly with apostrophes, using the wrong form of a word (particularly to and too) and redundancies (for example, a pale, light shade of green). I try to overlook such errors but there were enough that I found them distracting. Finally, I like to understand how the author arrived at the title. I'm not sure how the title fits this story, because I thought the saw with their hearts from the beginning. I know some readers might disagree with this whole paragraph.

""If My Heart Could See You"" is a sweeping tale of love between bitter enemies on the medieval Scottish border. Berwyck Castle has known peace under the rule of the MacLaren clan for around sixty years, but all of that is about to change. As two kings struggle for control and power of the region, the threat that war will come to Berwyck is imminent. The enemy is coming to claim the region for England, by order of King Henry, and the castle along with its inhabitants for himself. There will be blood and victory.
Our hero is a calloused warrior for the English, a man whose reputation precedes him as a dragon. Our heroine, the eldest daughter of the Laird MacLaren is quite the match for our dragon. She's every bit as fierce and fearless as she takes matters into her own hands to protect her family. She disguises herself as her twin brother and trains alongside the dragon... never expecting to fall in love with him!

""If My Heart Could See You"" is well written and researched, complete with multidimensional characters! In fact, the author has written a character that I truly despise. Even though I hate her I can't help but find myself hurting for her during these struggles... ah SABINA... silly wench!

4235,4,A16FWXT6WQH9X9,B00LRUI7QQ,"A lot of the comments here are comparing The Semi-Detached House to Austen - which is not surprising, since any domestic story from the 1800s tends to get compared to Austen. That comparison is not too far off, though; the only thing amiss here is that all the noble-born characters are noble of character as well, all the middle-class ones who accept their station are likeable and are immediately taken up by their high society neighbors, and only the social climbers are evil. Austen isn't quite so snobbish. Also, the portrayal of the Sampsons is stereotypically anti-Semitic (also odd - the author specifically says they're Jews, so why are they claiming they want to trade in the Far East to advance Christianity?) though their niece Rachel makes up for that to some degree.

What I found interesting, though, is that if The Semi-Detached House is influenced by Austen, The Semi-Attached Couple owes more to Trollope. It's as if Eden decided to try her hand at each author's style, just to see if she could handle it. She does a fairly creditable job, aside from the above-mentioned anti-Semitism that will be jarring to modern readers - it's one of those bits you just have to grit your teeth and try to ignore as being a relic of its time.",A lot of the comments here are comparing The Semi-Detached ...,10,6/6/2016

4249,3,A19CCHJ37SPNLJ,B00LS61SL0,"This book was a fine way to spend an afternoon. The story line was memorable and felt well researched in most areas.  The book could use better editing as there were seven typos and several romance scenes that were far from true to the period of time.  Several scenes felt transposed to the 21st century with virgins who know far too much about male sexuality and could feel the aroused state through all the clothing and knew what was happening.  This is so unlikely.  The courting patterns were also modern style- going immediately into passionate kisses rather than kisses on the hand and offering his arm when escorting her somewhere.  A woman who doesn't want the worst reputation would never allow a man to be over familiar with her in either public or in private.
 Other than the things I mentioned, it was a pretty good book.  It was good enough to entice me to buy the second In the series.  That was a mistake.  Most of the second in the series was a retelling of this book with very little added.  There is only a little added backstory added to a few minor characters from this story.

4258,5,A1IF7MXU4DQMVD,B00LS7ST98,"The second book in Foners hilarious Sci-Fi series takes place 5 years after the ending of the first book. Kelly and Joe are enjoying an overall happy and stable life with life and work in a good place  and they have an absolutely adorable toddler named Dorothy.

Things get interesting as the economic / political situation abruptly turns due to a very popular computer game / LARP game and suddenly humans go from the status of that loser being ignored in the corner to the absolute belle of the ball.

Absolutely everyone, and I do mean everyone, wants to woo the humans into a favorable alliance. Which means Kelly, as the Earth ambassador, is suddenly flooded with dinner invitations.

The book follows the same formula as the last one as Kelly goes on outing after outing, meeting, umm, colorful characters, and narrowly avoiding interstellar diplomatic incidents. Remember when Star Trek would have episodes really getting into different customs? Yeah, like that, but more so, since Foner doesnt have to worry about budget, censor, and special effects constraints.

Luckily, among all the weird, Kelly is steadied by having her husband accompanying her as cheerful arm candy, bringing a much needed shot of sanity to most situations  along with the booze, wisely telling her that they should tell all their hosts its a honored ancient human custom for a guest to bring their own alcohol  pragmatically ensuring no matter what alien fare (or worse, mistranslated human recipes) they are served, theyll at least have a drink or three to help them through the truly odd string of diplomatic dinners they sit down to.

Be warned, there is a LOT of economic theory tossed around, but it's worth it because most of it is aimed at making fun of chauvinist male pig-dogs who think little girls don't know how computer games work.

I was compelled to see if I was right.  The strength of the book, to me, were the settings and description which made it very real, but none of the characters, even the good guys, were likable because they were all so flawed and stereotypical,  the head detective on the case who was so enamored of his young partner, his hardworking ""boring"" wife, the victim, the abuser, the heart of gold villagers, and the predictable ending.",Disturbing,3,3/18/2017

4265,2,A2SI6BNK5SWSMD,B00LTUC5VC,"First Sentence:  Detective Inspector Ray Stevens stood next to the window and contemplated his office chair, on which an arm had been broken for at least a year.

While walking her son home from school, he releases her hand with disastrous results.  Jenna Gray leaves everything behind and moves to a remote cottage in Wales, hiding from her past.  A pair of investigators with the Bristol police are trying to solve the hit-and-run, but are frustrated at every turn.  Can the pieces be put together?

The prologue is the perfect example of a wide-awake nightmare.  It is painful to read, and a definite attention grabber.

The first third/half of the book almost reads more as a romance than suspense.  It is so disappointing when characters fall into predictably stereotypical situations.  But one wants to keep reading just to see where the story is going.  One thinks one knows, until one finds they are completely wrong.

Then comes the second and third parts of the story--talk about hugely disappointing.  It is as though Mackintosh watched Sleeping with the Enemy, and/or Jagged Edge.  That said, I do give her credit for knowing how to play with the readers loyalties and emotions.

Not only are many of the situations stereotypical, but so are most of the characters.  By far, the best character is Bethan, who has a secondary role.  That said, I do give her credit for knowing how to play with the readers loyalties and emotions.

I Let You Go had some strengths.  It also some major weaknesses which made it close to a wallbanger due, in part, to its horribly predictable ending.  I recommend letting this one go and moving on to something better.

The usual let's throw a bit of sex into the novel which did nothing to add to the depth or excitement of the story.  Have I read so many thrillers that the plot is easy to see.  It was so boring, just over halfway through I was skimming the pages to find anything that was relevant, I didn't like any of the characters, found it difficult to feel any sympathy for Jenny and the whole situation was ridiculous to say the least.

4267,3,A3S7POSKBI3OCB,B00LTUC5VC,"Caution, spoilers ahead:  Although I found this to be a page-turner, part of the reason I whipped through it so quickly (I read it in just over a day) was that I found it agonizing in terms of the main character's peculiar decisions about -- well, everything.  Her decisions immediately following the tragic accident were peculiar, even taking into account the pressures and threats she faced.  Then throughout the book she seemed to be her own worst enemy.

I guess if I had not personally been in a relationship somewhat similar to Jenna's marriage I would have been even less tolerant of her decision making.  But I know how an abusive mate can gaslight a person and make her doubt everything she once believed about herself and the world.  It happens, unfortunately, and I can't say it was a whole lot of fun to read the story of Jenna's tragic descent.  I also felt that Ray, the chief detective on the case, could have been an incredibly strong character if he had been more carefully crafted.  I really lose patience with authors who TELL me how a character is feeling rather than SHOWING me.  After scenes of tension or moral compromise, I grew weary of reading summary comments like (oversimplifying here):  ""Ray felt really bad about what he did.""

4269,4,A1H1GZ0MWHBWSC,B00LTUC5VC,"I'm going to admit I did not like the beginning of this book. I almost gave up and stopped reading at 40% but a lot of people I trusted gave this book high ratings so I kept at it. I even questioned how this could possibly be a thriller.. At around 46% the rug is completely pulled out from under you and the ride to the end is wonderful. This is one of the best plot twists I've ever read as it made me want to reread the beginning (which I didn't like) to see how I missed out on what was going on!

I'm not going to say much about the actual story itself because there is just about no way to do it without spoilers and you absolutely want to go in blind. I guessed part of what was happening in the beginning stages, but there is no way I could have came up with the whole picture on my own. So don't be afraid by other people's negative reviews with it being ""predictable."" They are just full of themselves IMHO.

The characters themselves are all fully fledged out and complex. The police have some back stories that are going on at the time of the main story line that are not fully resolved but I didn't truly care about them anyway. They are just there to keep the pacing of the story and not really necessary to the plot, but didn't necessarily detract from the story either.

4271,3,A23GMS38532ENZ,B00LTUC5VC,"I Let You Go is the name of the book, yet it is also what I did with the book, on multiple occasions. I let it go. I picked it up, thought about buying it, and then decided on another book. I did this at least four times. The first time I did it was the day that I bought Sleeping Giants by Sylvain Neuvel, which turned out to be my Book Of The Year.

But the other week I decided that I wanted to give I Let You Go a shot.

What made me pick up the book in the first place was the cover. The cover is a little dark and has a beach scene with the title written across the front. It looks as if a storm or some kind of trouble is on the way. As you read the story you will learn something about a main character that really makes the cover make sense. The cover artist did a great job creating a cover that actually has something to do with the story.

The book is told from the point of view of three characters. The book is also broken up into two parts. I cannot tell you how it is broken up in two parts without giving any spoilers so I wont. But there is a Part One and a Part Two.

Part One is told between two of the characters, Jenna Gray and DI Ray Stevens. In Part One, Jenna Gray is trying to put her life back together after the accident. We follow her journey as she tries to start a new life for herself. All the while, DI Ray Stevens is trying to solve the case.

Then Clare Mackintosh completely threw my world at the end of Part One, a twist I did not see coming.

The twist had me so excited for Part Two. I actually continued into Part Two without stopping. I had to know what happened.

As I said, the twist really surprised me and had me loving Mackintoshs writing style. Her next book, I See You, is scheduled to come out on February 21, 2017, in the United States Of America. I knew that I could not wait that long after reading the twist she threw in. I then went to the UK Amazon site and ordered I See You because it is available over there right now.

Clare Mackintosh had me loving the thriller/mystery genre again. I have not read many thrillers/mysteries as of late. There have been a few, but not many. I used to be a huge fan of James Patterson, but he puts out so many books it became hard to follow. Then I discovered Sci-Fi and have been reading a lot of that.

Part Two of the novel is almost at the halfway point; according to my Kindle it is at the 45% point. Here we get introduced to a third character, Ian Petersen. I cannot tell you about him without giving the story away. This part is also the downfall of the book, I feel like I should say in my opinion, even though that is what a review is. Not too far into Part Two, I had I Let You Go figured out. I should say, I knew who killed the boy and what would happen to the character, but I didn't know how Mackintosh would get us there.

When I got to the climactic scene at the end I was not surprised and I even rolled my eyes. There was a part in the final scene that I didn't see coming, but due to the fact I knew what was going to happen, it didn't really shock me like it should have.

But I don't want to beat Mackintosh up in this review. So what did I like?

Her writing is great. Even though I had the book figured out, I still enjoyed the ride she took me on. Never once did I feel bored reading and never did I want to put it down. She really knows how to keep you hooked.

Her chapter lengths are great too. The longest chapter took me about twenty minutes to read, most chapters took me about fifteen minutes. They are long enough so you can read a chapter before bed . . . but also long enough so you end up reading more and losing sleep. She also has several breaks in each chapter if you need to stop in the middle of it.

I also loved the characters. Each character has flaws and none are perfect, and I like that. Some characters make mistakes that will have you shaking your head. Other characters will have you so mad at them that you wish they would just die. The villain in the book is straight up evil and I could not wait for them to get what they deserved.

Overall this book is a fun and entertaining read. Part One is a shining star, while Part Two felt too predictable. Did the fact that I predicted the ending ruin the book for me? No. I still wanted to read to find out how all the dots would connect, even though they weren't surprises.

How about the audiobook? I am glad you asked. I did listen to some of the audiobook. Nicola Barber and Steven Crossley are the two narrators. As you can probably guess, Nicola Barber voices the chapters in Jennas point of view and Steven Crossley voices the chapters in DI Ray Stevens and Ian Peterses point of view. Each voice actor does a great job and it was easy to tell when two people were talking. If you enjoy audiobooks, this is a good one to pick up, of course I love their English accent.

If you enjoy thrillers and mysteries then you will probably enjoy the book.

The central issue is a tragic family drama which culminates in the death of an innocent child. There is a brutally accurate and realistic portrayal of abuse, told in the first person by the abuser, which makes it even more disturbing, but I really felt I understood the sickness of the abuser and the helplessness of the abused.
Fortunately, theres also a touch of sweet romance and lots of suspense, which kept me turning the pages to discover the shocking and unexpected final outcome. As in most crime fiction and police procedurals, the end seemed relatively optimistic and satisfactory, until I read the last line of the epilogue, so Im not sure...

The story starts out with a hit and run accident and Jacob, a young child fresh out of school that day, is killed. He had happily been skipping along anticipating milk; biscuit; twenty minutes of television, fish fingers for tea. a heart stopping opener.

The investigating duo of Kate and Ray arrive on the scene and as the book develops they rub along in an amicable working environment. For me, their relationship was not the strong point of the book, they are chatty, they work long hours, go to the pub, but the way their friendship pans out lacks building blocks.

Jennas world imploded on the day of the accident and she takes herself off to fictional Penfach on the Gower Peninsula where she tries to rebuild her life. The locals are initially supportive and she builds a small business photographing the sea and the beach, where she carefully writes messages for those who pay her to do it. Its a small income, she has virtually nothing now and lives in a run-down cottage that probably no-one else would rent.

One of the strands running through this is a relationship where domestic violence and abuse begins to rear its ugly head and the author tackles this invidious dynamic with insight and credulity. Below we have Comment from a couple counsellor

4277,5,A3NPRWXTO85BJ0,B00LVD00H8,"This novel is the first in the series, Vineland Murder Mysteries. It takes place in Napa, CA. The town is St. Helena. This is an area well known for it's wineries and tourist shops. Fine dining and art shows. Great live music as well.

The book opens with us meeting the owner of 'Violet Vineyards,' Clair de Montagne. Clair has a French surname but her personal heritage is Italian/Irish and has the strength of character to prove it. Claire is a protective mother of one daughter, 23 years old. Clair, herself, is just fifty.
Clair is married but having been estranged (for reasons you will learn) for decades is becoming aware of wanting to share her life again.

This book is rich in description of running a vineyard and gardens, the processing of the finished product and sales of same. The wine sounded amazing and so did the food.

Now for the murder (s), in the wee hours of the dawn, Claire is made aware that a favorite neighbor of hers has been found murdered in her vineyard by a shovel. That is just a beginning...I was amazed at the layers this full-length novel kept revealing. People's lies, accidents that weren't, Missing children, vandalism, arsons, love affairs and more!  It truly kept me turning the pages and being surprised in almost every chapter. I had a feeling about the culprit by location 4032 but was by no means sure. I was only partially correct.

Now, this is a murder with a lot of description and imaging.  Sometimes, I was a bit overwhelmed by what my brain was filling in. This was an excellent novel but not a 'Cozy genre.'",An Amazing Vineyard Murder Scheme,3,10/25/2016

4281,2,A2PZ93F1NJ716D,B00LWQAY8O,"The story as a whole to me was fine. The  idea of a young widow meeting her childhood love, who himself falls for her as well, is interesting enough. What i didn't like is the constant repetition of the hero's physical attributes and the heroine's plainness. It really galled me to the point of wanting to pull my hair off. I lost track of the number of times the author writes about ""handsome Harry"" this and that, and the number of times the word plain is attributed to the heroine: ""Plain, boring Olivia"", ""Olivias unfortunate plainness"", ""being average and plain"", ""too plain"", etc. It was so irritating and simply put me off the story; i can't even recall what there is to like. I don't care how ""handsome"" the hero is. According to the author he is so handsome ladies keep fainting and swooning upon sight of him. Come on, i just can't imagine that happening in reality. Although this is fiction, still, i expect my stories to be something i can relate in some ways. The author keep praising the hero as the most handsome, most perfect male specimen. The only thing that mar his perfection is his rakish ways, and even that is tweaked so he is still the perfect rake. Yeah, he became one in rebellion because he was denied his calling to become a man of the cloth for the simple reason that he is ""too handsome"". For goodness sake. Seriously? If it really was a calling, he would not have given up so easily. It's not as if England had but one parish for him to apply himself. The hero might have the looks, and he might be a doting uncle, but certainly not the smartest.

And then there is the issue about the hero and his brother growing up impoverished with their doting mother, their father having squandered their fortune. His brother, their father's heir, fares well, for he married an heiress. The hero somehow, is almost as rich as his sister-in-law due to him inheriting some and investing wisely. How and from whom he inherited is not clear though. He just became conveniently rich. Perhaps this is explained in other books, but as of now i am not interested in buying them. The hero was once the favourite lover of Olivia's aunt Charlotte, who must be a cougar of sorts for the hero was ""young enough to be in his teens"" and Olivia 12 when she met him for the first time. Uhm, awkward.

4285,5,A33CJ7F11Q5LD5,B00LXJVFUQ,"Before getting into the (really) good parts of the book, I must comment that the editing was just atrocious.  This is easily the worst editing Ive ever seen in a book with hundreds of errors ranging from omitted words, incorrect words, typos, space between letters (especially contractions), two words stuck together and more.  I found it incredibly frustrating to read for this reason, which is a shame since the book is so good.  In fact it is easily a 5 star book for content, but a 1 star book for editing.  Ordinarily I would have averaged the two and given the book a 3 star rating, but that would be a disservice to readers who might look at a 3 star review and skip this fantastic book.  Its worth reading despite the numerous errors.

As far as plot, home-grown terrorists detonate bombs at soft targets all around England with the goal of engendering the greatest amounts of terror.  (These are not military targets, but places where civilians congregate).  The Major Crimes Unit, an anti-terrorist group must stop the attacks.

What makes this book so great is the character Sarah Stone, a former army captain.  During her time in Afghanistan, her vehicle was torn apart by an IED and her entire squad killed by terrorists.  Sarah received grievous injuries, particularly to her face, leaving her with gruesome scars.  Almost simultaneously her husband was killed by friendly fire.  She has a lot to be angry about and understandably walks around with a major chip on her shoulder.  During the course of the story, Sarah confronts her past and comes to some sort of terms with it.

Although the story is resolved, the book ends on a cliffhanger, setting up the plot for the next book in the series.  It says a lot about how much I liked this book that I immediately bought it, despite the editing errors described above.","Fantastic Book, Horrible Editing",2,1/26/2016

Zak is a tattoo artist and new to town. Stitch is a crusty biker soured on women, men and apparently life. As Stitch is drinking his recent divorce woes away in a local bar, Zak walks in and feelings that Stitch cant outwardly express start a-stirring. Hes secretly in the closet, probably the reason his wife had had enough (well, theres also his not-at-all charming personality). The two strike up a conversation, as you will, and Zak offers to cover up Stitchs misguided tattoo of his ex-wife's name. Its waaaaay up on his inner thigh but Zak decides to take a look right there anyway, as you will, and agrees to take on the job.

After he fixes the tat, well, things happen and then Stitch acts like a jerk because he chooses to remain in complete denial about his sexuality. Well, theres that and the fact that hed probably be murdered by his MC if they knew. But basically he's just a drug running, jealous, violent, angry man-boy and I won't be swayed into thinking otherwise. So don't bother trying to change my mind in the comments.

She basically needs to have staff assisting her through life for 16 if not 24 hours a day. The two male protagonists, desperately in love with her for some reason*, decide to team up and meet that need for staff, except that one marries her, and they both shag her.

As someone in the mental health field, I have an immediate knee-jerk ICK reaction at the idea of caregivers in a sexual relationship with their patient. Having sex with a vulnerable person in your power is inappropriate and creepy. And I honestly don't know how the two men could find her attractive when she's constantly hallucinating, delusional, frantic... I know she's beautiful, but seriously, she is VERY ill, in crisis almost constantly. To find that sexy tells me that they must have problems, too, and it just turns this whole thing seriously gross.

* Because she doesn't have much of a personality beyond her mental illness. There's no Amelia for them to get to know and fall in love with. There's just constant freak-outs, word salad, and erratic behavior. So I don't understand why the two guys are so devoted to her-- what has inspired such faithful adoration, besides the author's deus ex machina decision that they do? Bleh.",ick,8,1/23/2016

It's a short story estimated to be 63 pages long so you'll probably only need an hour or so to read it. I didn't love it as much as the first book, but for a novella it was very good. Ms. Maxton seems to have a knack for fleshing out her characters in a limited number of pages which is a rare talent. Since both Anne and Michael were introduced in 'The Affair' I'd definitely recommend reading that story first.

I went into this already liking Anne who was outspoken and impulsive. I wasn't sure I'd like Michael, since he seemed really uptight and judgmental. However, after a chance meeting where he catches her ""borrowing"" a naughty novel, a correspondence is started and they get to know each other. Michael begins to admire Anne and stops trying to live up to others expectations and simply be himself. By the end, I had a complete turnaround and ended up liking Michael more than Anne.

Overall it was a quick read that was well written and enjoyable. The author took both the naughty book and Anne's tendency toward wagering and made them key components of the plot which was unique and refreshing. The love scenes were spicy and passionate, and the connection between these two was undeniable.

Best bits: Both Tess and Ryder had messed up birth parents, though Ryder was adopted into a loving home when he was 10 and Tess is still dealing with the aftermath of life with her crazy mother. Now, they both dedicate themselves to saving lives as EMTs. They're both good people, and both rather hung up on each other, though only Tess admits it to herself, and neither wants to mess up their friendship by being the first to move them towards romance. Definitely two very similar people, and once Ryder can get past his fear of losing someone he loves, they seem golden.

Issues: Plenty of typos and wrong words, as well as formatting errors with paragraph breaks happening where they shouldn't (especially in conversations, where it got really confusing as to who was talking at times) and not where they should. A handful of places where thoughts or memories really need to be set apart by italics. Not a fan of the ""quotes"" from characters that start each chapter (this time on separate pages before the chapters?). They feel forced and unnecessary.

This book is not telling you to do what she did or how to parent a child but more so of sharing her ways and tips that she used and how they helped. I loved it because it was a lot of the same things that I believe and did even. Especially, in the beginning, I had the same issue with breastfeeding. I did not produce enough for my son and he cried and cried, I cried buying the formula and made his daddy feed him because I was heartbroken. I felt as if I let me son down, myself and everyone else. Mainly because everything out there and everyone around was telling me how to raise my child and professionals out there telling you how to raise your child. This book is not that way, it really would have been nice to read even before my pregnancy. :P Every parent is different, every child is different. Do your parenting how you want to, but do not be discouraged to not listen or take advice from some other mommies also, just know that you DO NOT have to do what they did. But sometimes they do have some great tips and experiences. :) The Author covers almost every subject there is with parenting and making them short and sweet, but never pressuring and I love that. Because there are a couple things I did not agree with but I loved her reasoning behind the ways that she did things. This is a great read for a mommy or mommy to be, I even think it would be great in a new mommy gift basket or baby shower gift. :) Great book!

This book is basically Fantasy Island meets BDSM.  75% of the book is about the fantasy fulfillment of the three guests to the island for this particular weekend.  They each have a different fantasy.  There are several stories going on and it jumps from story to story without giving any notice as to when it switches storylines (it wasn't done by chapters or annotated with there names at the start) and you had to read several lines to figure out which story you were in.  Dimitri and Mariah only have a paragraph or so here and there for the first 75%.  At that point their story takes off like a rocket.

with that said - It was a little confusing with the story jumping (it worked way better on Fantasy Island which was visual so you knew which story you were in at the moment) but the storylines are good.  The writing is very detailed from the environment to clothes to scenes.  There are many characters in the book and the authors to a good job in fleshing them out fairly decently.  The wrap-up of the storylines play out just like Fantasy Island (good beginnings but no definitive endings).

4318,5,AA0MZGAGD35LD,B00M4N1JX8,"I have been gardening for many years. I have always included my kids. This is the first book about gardening that I have read that includes the involvement of children. This is a great idea especially because children learn so much from gardening from team work to caring for other to how things work.

Although I love gardening, I still have a lot to learn. Here I  learned about double digging, staggered planting, where to get a free soil test kit, and so much more. Also, I had never even heard the term friendship garden. I am amazed and intrigued by the idea of friendship gardens. What a great way to give back to the community.

Seeing the mass amount of chemicals everywhere is disturbing. I am very happy to see the encouragment and resources shared to achieve organic gardening. I plan to share this with my child's school.

This has been a fun but short read. The included planting guides are very handy. Although this booked is aimed at those gardening in North Carolina, It has lots of useful information for anyone who loves gardening.

I don't usually plant a fall garden, but after reading this guide, we will be attempting one this year. I didn't know to plant things deeper in the fall until now. I also learned about Winter gardneing. I now understand why I have failed at this in the past.","Short, Fun, informative.",3,5/11/2016

4320,5,A2MXW7029E6JD5,B00M5EHGZQ,"I read the Over Duet earlier this year (which is EXCELLENT by the way and I highly recommend it!) and knew that I wanted to go back and meet all the other amazing characters I was introduced to and find out their back stories as well. Hope Over Fear is Sara's story and I loved every heartbreaking and uplifting minute!

The characters and story hooked me from the start and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out what was going to happen and what kind of emotional baggage our hero and heroine were carrying. I loved having both Sara and Adam's points of view, though I did wish for a few more Adam chapters so we could have known what was going on inside his head! Some moments were extremely emotional and painful, while others were lighthearted and laugh out loud hilarious (man, I love Cain and Marlo!)

Sara and Adam have intense and incredible chemistry, but that kind of powerful and all consuming passion can also easily give way to anger and rip your heart out of your chest if given the chance. The issues they face were realistic and relatable and both of them had to grow and accept themselves and each other to really move forward. I loved the overall message that families come in all different shapes, sizes, and combinations, and that loving yourself is just as important as loving someone else. The secondary characters were just as amazing as Sara and Adam, and I can't wait to read Alex's story in the next book, Wings over Poppies!",We Are All Works in Progress,3,8/3/2017

TWO: I started reading JA DeRouen with Low Over High and Ever Over After first; it was a little out of order. With that being said, I love how it is totally OK to go back and picking up this one and it all be completely new. Nothing was ruined by starting the series at the end.

THREE: The words were just as good if not better as the cover. There is something I craved about JA DeRouen's writing, and SHE DID NOT DISAPPOINT with Hope Over Fear. I really loved this story. I love the detail that she put into the story that makes you feel like you are apart of it. The romance between the two main characters is undeniable. She made me love Sara and fall so hard for Adam.

It detracted from the characters' conversations and made them all sound low class, ignorant, and unprofessional.

It is missing the hook. There is nothing to grab you and draw you into any of the characters, even Adam. With a long list of characters, interactions, and personalities, the author failed to deliver anyone likable. I couldn't relate to the characters and the story line fell so flat and often all over the place that it was a really hard book to finish. If a character has an issue, a secret, it should be something angsty that pulls you in. Something they seek redemption for. Her issue was just childish and dumb. I read to escape and know this means stories that are not as true to life as some. This was just so unbelievable in every aspect.

Look, there's nothing wrong with smoothies, but I'm not certain why you would bill a boxed set as a detox diet when all it really is is smoothie recipes. The recipes are uninspired. It's getting to the point where I might say, just look in your fridge crisper and blend it all together with a handful of ice. Done. The only thing saving this thing from a 1 star review is that it does attempt to shake things up with adding nuts instead of nut butters (those are in there too) and it does make a weak attempt at telling you what the use for the ingredients in question are. Here's my real question about books like these: If you're just blending whole veggies/fruits/nuts, etc. to drink...why not just eat them? How is this different from eating them except you're not chewing. If you're always on the go and you don't want to chew...I guess you can afford to invest in smoothie books. Just not certain why detox is always smoothie.

I am lucky that I have very very qualified aromatherapist friends for my sources. Honestly, anyone can write a book. Do your own research please that is very important.

4331,3,A1T968H1HEHQCP,B00M5EV6X4,"The first book concerns freezer meals, which is a way to save time during the week while ensuring you can still have a hot meal at the end of the day or to start your day. This isn't a bad idea and we do it sometimes too, but we won't be using most of these as they aren't as spiced or flavorful or veggie rich as we like. There's three recipes in here that we will use, but with a lot of modifications. The author also gives some helpful tips on preparation and storage of these meals.

The second book has a section on green juicing and the other on quinoa. There's multiple juicing recipes I liked and several have already made it into rotation so far including the first juice using coconut water I've ever liked. There's an excellent Swiss chard and collard green one and the flavors in all the ones I've tried so far have been well balanced so you're not experiencing too much sweetness from fruit or too much bitterness from certain greens.

However the section on quinoa really bothered me. When anybody is that adamant that something will transform your life and help solve all problems, it comes across as culty or snake-oil salesmany. I'm not disputing that quinoa is a great food for a variety of reasons or that a healthy diet helps improve your life, it was just presented too over-the-top and in too devoted a manner. Mostly the breakfast section of recipes appealed to me-some tasty combinations I hadn't been previously doing. The main dishes relied heavily on meat but there was a quinoa casserole with pineapple I like and a quinoa frittata my SO likes. My SO is interested in trying some of the other main dish meat ones in the future. There's also an herb bread recipe that is quite good.

The next book has 11 smoothie recipes. I liked the Pumpkin Pineapple and  Kale Romaine ones so far.  Though there is one smoothie that added sugar which I didn't understand as it was pretty fruity and didn't need it. There's a link to a ""healthy nutrition system"" that redirects to an error message. The next book is about smoothies for weight loss. Each recipe included personal rules for weight loss that were the same for each recipe. That unnecessary repetition got under my skin a bit.

The next book is on clean eating and there's a Pita Sauce my SO adores. There's another few books on smoothies and juicing which I've seen as parts of other sets before. As such I consider them ""bonus books"" and didn't go through each recipe individually again.

For me the second book is the most useful. It has the most recipes that I'll use that I haven't (so far) seen bundled elsewhere. As a free Kindle book, this is worthwhile to download. If you aren't familiar with cooking ahead for the week or the month, the tips provided in the first book are useful. You can always modify the recipes or use your own once you know the techniques. I've been looking at a number of juicing books lately, and I definitely like the juices provided in the second book. I also walked away with recipes from the quinoa section and a few from the next couple of books. I did have to go through some clunkers (for me - tastes are subjective) and was sometimes turned off by the writing..

4332,4,A30L7ES6E5PS0U,B00M5EV9JK,"This box set, Juicing for Weight Loss: The Ultimate Boxed Set Guide (Speedy Boxed Sets), contains three informative juicing books. The box set begins with the table of contents, which does not contain page numbers on which one can locate the recipes; instead, on the Kindle version of the book, each section of the book is written in a hyperlink fashion, in order to enable to user to simply click the section head they are interested in prior to being automatically directed to the first page of that book or chapter. I consider the hyperlinks to be a nice, easy method to flip to a certain recipe in this book. However, I do wish that the hyperlinks for the books in the box set were in a larger font or somehow easily differentiated from the chapters within the books, instead of a slight indentation. In addition, direct links to each recipe would be beneficial, as only one book features these hyperlinks to recipes.

The first book, entitled Juicing Recipes for Weight Loss: Lose Weight Naturally, was written by Valerie Alston. This book is separated into three parts, each of which contain pertinent information for juicing. The book dives right into a short introduction detailing what juicing is and how it is beneficial to individuals. Part 1 then provides and discusses specific benefits of juicing in terms of health. From this point, the recipes are located in part 2 of the book. The recipe information contains a title, introduction, ingredients, specific ingredient quantities, and directions. There are 15 juicing recipes in total. Part 3 contains 5 juicing tips to aid in this diet plan. The book ends with a conclusion and thank you message.

The second book of the set, by Lana Scholl, is Juicing Diet: Juicing Recipes and Juicing Nutrition You Need to Do It Right. This book starts with an introduction, which provides information about juicing, such as what this diet involves, benefits, caloric intake, etcetera. The author then discusses how to choose the right juicer for you and traveling with juice, before beginning the recipe portion of the book. The book has 13 fruit-only juices, each of which contains a title, introduction, ingredient list, ingredient quantities, and a procedure. There are 10 green juice recipes, 15 fruit and vegetable combination recipes, and 15 savory juice recipes setup in the aforementioned manner. Following the recipes is a 3-day juicing diet plan, information on a 10-day juicing diet plan, and breaking the juicing fast. The book ends with a short conclusion.

The third book in the box set actually included 3 books in 1, entitled Best Green Smoothie Recipes for Weight Loss & Juicing for Weight Loss + Smoothies are Like You, was written by Juliana Baldec. The book begins with book 1 (which is more aptly titled section 1), which includes blender recipes for weight loss. This book begins with a why you should read this book segment, followed by the authors personal rules for weight loss with the smoothie recipes provided. The book goes on to delve into some recipes. The recipes are setup with a title, introduction, benefits, ingredient list (with specific quantities), and directions. This book also includes pictures of all of the smoothies. There are 16 smoothie recipes. Following these recipes is a discussion of interactive ways for healthy living, a blender recipes for weight loss quiz, and a conclusion. After this information is 2 more books setup in the same manner as discussed above. Book 2 includes the 5 minute 6 step juicing system and why this diet plan works, before including 13 juicing recipes. The book then discusses juicing for weight loss, an effortless juicing process, wheat grass elixir information, juicer reviews, a juicing quiz, and a conclusion. The final book in the series is how smoothies are like you. This is essentially a poem book about smoothies, including an A-Z list of poems.

Overall, I had only a few minor issues with the books in this box set. I do wish the books were more uniform, but since there are different authors, the differences in recipe layout, for example, are understandable. There were minimal issues with the layout of the books. The main issue with recipe books generally being that the titles would somehow be at the bottom of a page and/or there was no easy differentiation between some of the recipes, as they would start and stop in the middle of pages. There were only a handful of these issues in the books. There were no glaringly obvious/repeated grammatical or spelling issues that made me want to cringe as I was reading the books. The first two books were short, but thorough in the information pertaining to the diet plan. The recipes themselves seemed like they would (for the most part) be delicious and fairly quick to make, in addition to requiring limited to no specialty ingredients. All in all, the first two books were well made. The third book, however, does contain some repeated information, advertisement, and wordy, useless fluff. The recipes are overall easy to make, yummy, and require little to no specialty ingredients. This first two books are simplistic, but thorough in its discussion of the diets, recipes, and meal plans. The third book felt like I was being overwhelmed with information, fluff discussions, and I learned only a small amount about the diet plan. I would highly recommend the first two books in the set for those interested in learning more about the specifics of each diet and delicious recipes. The third book is still worth reading, just be aware it is lengthy discussion with minimal recipes.

The main purpose was to be used as home remedy to treat minor afflictions and it had a reintroduction of the healing effects in the early 1900s by European scientists, although those scientists must have brought this knowledge from Middle East, Asia and far regions.

This is the first book I have read from this author.  I know it is the first in the ""a secret shopper mom mystery ""  series.  I see from the Amazon website Ms. McClymer has other books and series on offer, too.  I found this book to be well written and it fits the cozy mystery formula well.  It is a short read, not overly sexual nor violent, and wraps up well in the end.  I cannot say it's a standout for me, because I felt buried under the angst of this mom not being perfect in her own eyes.  This is something most moms go through, especially those who work.  Most come to grips with it and accommodate where they have to in order for it to work.  Poor Molly, however, is gnawing on it constantly and it wore me down.  Some more time could have been given to settings, i.e., the home, the campus, the scenery, size of the town, and her relationships with her friends.  It would have fleshed out the story for me.  We never get a picture of Molly from anyone but her own.  It made it hard to fully appreciate her character.  I mentioned Ms. McClymer had written more than just this one book.  Reviews seem to be posting well, so I think she has probably improved over time and her books have better writing with each one.  That said, it is a good cozy and not an upsetting read as some types of mysteries can be.  They all have their place and this one is great as a cozy.  I want to read more of this author's work to see how her writing has grown since this was written.

4336,3,A2O9YBU2NAFOGV,B00M5P0EZE,"This book has a lot of great ideas for keeping the brain sharp and training it work better. After working in a nursing home and then an Alzheimer and Dementia unit I became increasingly interested in how to (hopefully) keep my brain as healthy possible. There are quite a few studies that show doing puzzles and reading help people who are in the early stages of Alzheimer's slow the progression, these books are taking that idea and giving you ideas on how to implement it.

We start off with a chapter about why these games are important for the brain. Then there is a list of speed exercises (these are to learn to speed read), numerical exercise, word puzzles and then memory puzzles. These are not actual exercises that you do in the book (other then the word puzzles)  but rather ideas and suggestions on what to do.

In the second book we get ideas on how to increase memory, attention span and more tips on brain health and training. One of these that I found interesting was using your non-dominate hand. I do this a lot just out of habit so I found it interesting that I am actually helping my brain when I use my left hand to eat or write.

The third book starts out with a list of supplements and food that are good for the brain, honestly this is nothing new and something anyone with Google can find. We then learn about mind mapping and journaling and then it goes back into habits and exercises the other books had pretty much already covered.

The first two books are definitely worth a read, the third is a little lengthy for what little new information is given.

My fault really because I was expecting it to be full of games and riddles and exercises rather than just explaining how and why your brain functions as it does. It holds good content it just wasn't what I was looking for.
In Part I, Chapter 4 there are a handful of riddles and questions to get your brain working. I really enjoyed reading through these but there were never any answers to the riddles so I have no way of knowing if I was right or not. Later in Chapter 6 there are more riddles, or brain teasers, and those thankfully have answers on the following page. I had a great time with these and asked my children (ages from 7 to 12) each one. It was fun to see how they worked through them to find an answer. Some of the questions I couldn't figure out but my seven year old got it right away. It was really cool to see how all of our brains worked differently to solve the problem.
There are a lot of good suggestions in this book on what to do to strengthen your brain function but overall I found it to be repetitive and overly verbose. It wasn't what I was looking for. I suppose I need to look for a book of just brainteasers, riddles, and puzzles.

Games that we played as kids such as the memory game are mentioned, and the author breaks down other games that are good for adults to utilize as we get older.
Chapter 2 discusses how to keep our mind sharp and offers 10 exercises for the process of sharpening our minds. Suggestions given are chunk words you read, and training you eyes to focus a certain way. There are other exercises as well but I will save them for your reading pleasure.
Chapter 3 and on,  is brain and memory games suggestions.  The author lists a few quiz questions for you to answer, but most of this book is about other resources you can use to train your mind.  So in my opinion its more of a resource book than a book of like puzzles and such.  It will tell you which puzzles and things to go buy, per say.

The second book is on brain training and how to improve concentration, your memory and IQ.
The first 2 chapters give you some background info on memory but the 3rd chapter is interesting because it lists signs your brain may be deteriorating. Chapters 4-6 are on how to think faster, how to improve your memory and how to increase your attention span. Chapter 7 offers some basic brain training tips, most of the information there is common sense, and chapter 8 offers suggestions on how to boost your IQ through different sources like games we have all heard of.  There are no games given, its just which ones to buy yourself.
Chapter 9 is on brain training facts, and that goes into chapter 10 which discusses degenerative diseases and brain training.

The third book is about Increasing brain power, improving power of the brain and memory.
The first chapter discusses diet and the brain, the author also takes you on their journey, and I found this chapter kind of interesting.
Chapter 3 is on the power of journaling.  Journaling has many benefits in our life, but I never connected the dots it would be good for my brain.
Chapter 4 may bring up some resistance in people, because the author discusses the benefit of power napping, but most people don't get enough sleep at night, so this will resonate with a lot of people.
Chapter 5 discusses the reasons to lower your blood pressure and how that messes with brain function.
Chapter 6 is all about meditation and reducing the stress, calming the mind and finding the stillness.
Chapter 7 is about getting fit and in shape, which yup, that's good for your brain!
Chapter 8 is exercising through games, and which ones are good for you to try.
Chapters 9 and 10 talk about reading, and doing different things to add new interests.
Chapters 11 through 15 are just on friendships, doing things to change up your routine like getting interested in music.
Chapter 16 talks about breathing.  Breathing is important because it increases oxygen to the brain, calms us, and increases our health. She provides exercises for us to start deeper breathing.
Chapter 17 is all about nutritional supplements. The last few chapters go from thinking, to practicing hypnosis, speed reading, making your subconscious work for you, getting to know yourself, being your motivator, decreasing your stress, learning something new, changing the way things look.
I would say this was the best book of all 3.  There were a lot more helpful tips of changing your lifestyle to become a healthier, calmer person.

I received these books for free in exchange for my honest opinion.
I think the first 2 books really hit home on common sense things you can do through games, puzzles, reading, to help improve your brain function.
The last book was more enjoyable to read because she gets to the heart of the important things like meditation, journaling, becoming more peaceful, slowing down, and less stress does improve our cognition.",Some parts were better than others,13,3/21/2016

4341,4,A1RUY5OU5U21J9,B00M5P0EZE,I have found myself with a brain fog lately and I figure it is just work and stress but I want to do something about it because I do not want to become permanent thing. So I came upon the boxed set  Brain Training and Brain Games. So at first it lets you know why it is important to keep your brain strong and your memory intact. It also says that everyone should do this and do it every day because it is every important.  Then it goes through a lot of different ways that you can get this done. One way I found surprising was speed reading. I don't think that I could ever do this.  Another tip that they say is to do a lot of numerical games or problems. I found this one challenging because I don't like math because I hate math and I think that you should do things that you like to do. I kept reading and it said that you could do crossword puzzles or popular games that are available on the app store. I found that the information in the books was helpful and that it was things that I could do fairly quickly and easily and some things were things that were things that I was already doing.  I found the way that it was written was very handy and it had very easy to read. I could put the book away and pick it up quickly and not be confused as to what I was just reading.

4342,3,A2MC1WWC0GXFCK,B00M5P0EZE,"I read the entirety of this box set, and it is indeed informative. The set is comprised of three different books that give information about ways to improve your memory and brain health. The first book in the box set was probably my favorite, since it was the only one that contained actual puzzles for the reader to do. Granted, the puzzles were all word brain teasers. There weren't any actual puzzles (like mazes, Sudoku, etc). However, there was a nice section in the first book that listed many different types of games and puzzles that you could play, and gave a description of each and how they would be beneficial to your brain.
The second book was similar to the first in that it gave scientific information about the brain, but much of what was said was already written in the first book, so it was kind of a dull read for me. It was still informative, though, and there were points in it that were not mentioned in the first book.
The third book was also very good. This one had a nice list of different foods and vitamins that are good for brain health. It also had different activities you could do to improve brain health. There was a lot of good information in this book, not just for mental health, but for your entire physical well-being.
Besides the second book in the box set being kind of a bust with me, the only real con I have is that the title of the box set as a whole is a bit misleading. The set is called ""Brain Training and Brain Games"", yet there really weren't any brain games, besides what was in book one. It is an informative set, though, and gives some great ideas for improving your brain health and memory.

4345,2,AQW172A5SG5OC,B00M5P0EPO,"I wouldn't agree that this book is ""the ultimate guide"" but it's a pretty good beginner's guide. If you believe in detox cleanses to begin with. (And I don't.)

I disagree with the author's premise that ""everyone needs a colon cleanse."" Doctors rarely advise this kind of treatment because of the removal of important digestive bacteria in the gut that can happen with a colon cleanse. Also, those who are suffering from anorexia or other eating disorders might find that a colon cleanse does more harm than good; bulimics, for example, may participate in regular colon/detox cleanses as a way of purging. However, people who are struggling with bowel movements may indeed be prescribed a perfectly good natural supplement like docusate sodium or a fiber supplement, and these are the best to gently rid the colon of excess fecal matter.

But anyway, my knowledge and expertise doesn't matter, this is a book review. Yes, getting excess fecal matter expunged from the body can make you feel pretty good! But if your bowel movements are already pretty good and regular, then you don't need a colon cleanse.

The author doesn't explain what ""harmful toxins"" might be in your system. It's pretty upsetting for me to see that the author encourages readers not to use ""unnatural medication"" to cleanse. Ugh. Some people need medication to get things moving - for many different reasons, like if you're taking pain medication, that can slow down the bowels significantly. So the author is really unfortunately pushing her own agenda, and potentially encouraging people to make dangerous decisions that can impact their health.

Also, these books contain information about the natural ways of detox and the use of certain methods, like juicing, like consuming Psyllium among other to keep your colon clean and your body healthy.

A data written on this set of books caught my attention at all and that was the section about the three different types of Psyllium you can intake as a supplement and the reasons why you should have NAC (N-Acetyl-Cisteine) as a very important supplement to keep body detoxified, to improve nails and hair, to remove heavy metals, to clean mucus from your respiratory system (helps on people with asthma) and many more benefits.  I do recommend you to learn more about NAC and its benefits.

In the 1st book, you will find information about the meaning of Colon Cleanse, you will read about the different methods of Colon Cleansing and you will learn about the benefits of having your Colon Cleansed.  You will also learn about natural colon cleanse recipes, herbal colon cleanse, parasite colon cleanse, the use of laxatives, how to fight cancer with colon cleansing, alternative diets and how to lose weight by colon cleansing.

In the 2nd book you will find advice and recommendations about what to do before starting detox, the use of Psyllium, detox drinks and benefits coming from, detox with fruits and vegetables, juicing recipes and key ingredients to follow a healthy diet.  You will learn about 17 super foods that will help you to maintain a healthy lifestyle and a clean colon too.

Weve learned that a natural form of Detox could be by the intake of smoothies and juices that contained enough active ingredients to boost our digestive system, to clean our blood by the release of toxins, to intake of higher amount of nutrients in a higher bio digestibility form and other benefits inherent by eating healthier instead of a junk food diet.

4347,5,A2C2ONJVVKM0FE,B00M5P6LV0,"This Kindle book (actually 3 books boxed set!) provides a good introduction into what minimalist living is and gives a good definition. The only thing that I would like different were some more illustrations, but I am also a visual person. So that is just my opinion.
The book also provides definitions of the different types of minimalist living and how the idea of living a minimalist lifestyle can vary from person to person. It talks about ways to ""declutter"" your life in each aspect from the food you eat, the clutter in your home, stuff in your work space, to the toxic people you may have in your life. The book talks about different strategies for going about getting rid of items, cleaning up, and decluttering.
The book also talks about ways to categorize your stuff, create storage solutions, the importance of setting aside just a few minutes each day, and taking a minute to simply clean up after yourself. There is also a chapter on organizing and decluttering your finances. The book provides tips on creating an emergency fund and leaving a consumerism and a materialistic lifestyle behind.
It also talks about living debt free, avoiding creating more debt, and the best ways to pay your bills. This is a huge topic to some people and is a big part of living as a minimalist.
 This book provides additional tips on some of the topics discussed in the first book and also talks about how to shop. There is also a third book that again talks about the benefits of this lifestyle and provides tips on how to get started. It also talks about repurposing items and creativity. Again there is more information on finances and how to shop as a minimalist. This boxed set provides and expands on a lot of great tips about living the minimalist lifestyle.

I read it twice because a few days after I read it the first time I kept thinking about it and wondering, how did the author do it?  The story presented a few characters who are working on an aircraft carrier, and in a couple quick scenes I found myself in a super-tense dangerous situation.  There was humor, tough decisions, rough confrontations, near death experiences, and a bit of bro-mance all involving high-tech jet planes and the tough sailors who fly them and maintain them.

And while that is still true, his books are about so much more.  Gene Roddenberry, the first writer to have his Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, was optimistic about the future.  And while Jay Allan sees humanity progressing technologically, in his world we remain the same warmongering, polluting and murderous species that we are today.  And as much as I'd rather live in Roddenberry's future I believe Jay Allan's future is more likely to come true.

As much as I am probably the only person on the planet who enjoyed episodes I, II, and III of  Star Wars, I enjoyed them because it was like watching history, namely, when Hitler legally seized power in Germany and then gathered absolute power to himself before launching World War 2.  But in reading the Crimson Worlds saga it kind of feels like I'm reading the future, the same way Star Wars showed us our past.  Scary.  But if you don't learn from the past you're doomed to relive it, maybe great writers like Jay Allan can begin to lead humanity toward Gene Roddenberry's future.  All that being said, these books are exciting and compelling and just downright fun.  I highly recommend this series.

Book ONE:
Aern meets Emily under deadly circumstances. She saves him in order to find her sister but gets more than she expects in the bargain. Forced to put her hands in the life of a stranger that may or may not have kidnapped her sister, she has no choice but to go with him. As the story unfolds Aern discovers that Emily is more than just human and may be the key to their survival.

Book TWO:
Brittany become more and more crucial to the survival of the world and needs all the help she can get, especially from Logan, the man in her visions. Their relationship unfolds as they race to save their people from the corrupt Morgan.

Melissa Wright displays an undeniable talent at profiling interesting characters and complex plots, all believable and starting you thinking deeply. Each book in the series ends in a perfect way, no cliffhanger here; (how fulfilling), each follow-up story is not an after thought but a natural event; the reader coming to the understanding there will be no closure if the past is not unveiled, if the prophecy is not revealed in all its different possible interpretations.

Although the Descendants Series is a Y.A. Paranormal genre, it is not a teenager fantasy per se, more constructed like an epic story which could have been played by older adults.

The romance side is subtle, an exchange of energy and powers between the characters, not an hormone ridden teenage crush dwelling into physical attraction under the pretext of fated love. There is a depth in analyzing situations and roles worth our time and attention, a truth coming up book after book as we start to understand who are the forebears of the descendants, and how their fate could not have been avoided.

From the first meeting between the two of them they hated each other. What makes it worst is the Prince keeping her as hostage in his own home and country. Arguing, bickering, fighting, tongue-lashing they just couldn't stop. Amidst all of that love blossomed between the two.

I am surprised that I really enjoyed this story. I have read plots like this before but what makes this one intriguing is the twist and turn that has been added also the unconventionality of defying the prince's order.

And then BAM! Cherry Poppin' Sexy Times. (I should mention, the author also messed up and called Saja (the main character), Macee during these sexy times.

I think the character interaction is what killed this for me. I really saw no major shift in Prince Al-Qadir's attitude towards women. Pretty sure, he was still wanting to ""tame"" Saja and there really was no emotion coming from him or her for that matter. He was being led around by a feeling in his groin, and I'm not even sure what she was being led by.

First and foremost , it takes you behind the scenes in real-world venues you may never see any other way. And in doing so, Book 1 defines a time and place in scintillating detail that only first-hand familiarity can bring. Second, the characters are gripping, so real they breathe. And, third, the seeds of the subsequent volumes are artfully placed, never intrusive, but fetching enough to make me buy the other three when I'd only gotten three-quarters through the first novel.

I enjoyed this one like I did the other.  (Both are part of the same series, so I cant say for certain if these qualities pertain to books outside the series.)

No real challenges with this one other than to say it will require your full attention.  The twists come at you fast and furious, and the momentum is a mile a minute.  So if your attention drifts for even a brief bit, as it might at the end of the day when you're tired, youll have to go back and pick up reading where you left off.

While I could buy the forbidden sex the first time it happened, from the way the male lead was portrayed as never straying during his entire marriage up to this point, no matter how long he'd been away or how tired he'd been from traveling, I couldn't buy it happening more than the one time.

Savanna Tate and Tyler Mitchell have been together since they were fourteen, as they grew things started to change for Savanna. She asked Tyler for some time apart but the lattet took things the wrong way.

Tyler got his heart broken by the one woman he ever loved, Savanna. So when she called things off, he started to spiral out of control. When Savanna found him with his pants down she ran and a drunken Tyler followed her.

Which let to Ty having a terrible accident, he found himself in a coma for six months. Savanna became the bad guy in this story for Ty's family, except for Ty's cousin Colt Mitchell who was the only one that believed Savanna.

Colt and Savanna grew closer and eventually the latter followed her heart which let her away from Tyler and closer to her happiness.

Folding Hearts

After losing Van to his cousin, Tyler found himself girlfriend less while Savanna and Colt looked forward to their future together. Colt wasn't handling the loss of his father very well ao being a friend to both Colf and Savanna, Ty was her shoulder to lean on.

Miranda was Colt's cousin by their mothers' sides, as Colt and Savanna were dealing with everything. A very pregnant Miranda and Ty had been spending a lot of time together.

When Miranda went inyo labor, Van and Ty was right there with her. They didn't make it to the hospital, the little beautiful bundle of jog was delivered in the car by Ty. The man immediately fell in love with the baby, who was named Isabella.

Miranda was dating a good for nothing punk by the name of Tucker Chase, the man didn't care about Isabella nor Miranda. Seeing the situation that she was in, her family send her and Izzy to stay with Tyler and his parents in North Carolina.

Ty and Miranda didn't had the best records when it came to relationships, despite their past mistakes they found themselves falling more and more in love with each other. When everyone around them tried to stand in their way, they showed them that what they had was pure and true.

Raging Love

As Savanna and Colt were preparing for their wedding day, there was lots of obstacles they had to face. It was as if the universe was trying to tell them something. No matter what was thrown their way, their loved ones weren't not gonna let their big day get ruined.

Savanna was going through some things, she was really having a rough time. But with the love and support of her family and her better half she made out fine.

I loved all the twists and turns that Colt and Savanna had to deal with. She was one tough cookie, life wasn't fair to her but she never gave up.

Colt and Savanna got an unexpected surprise, they might have lost a lot but they gain much more in the end.

Risking Fate

Miranda and Ty Mitchell were married, after facing some ups and downs with their family who wasn't too happy about their union. Things were looking great, they loved each other completely and their family of three was getting a new addition.

A lot happened in the first few months of Miranda's pregnancy, her brother Connor was out of control, partying too much. An altercation between him, Ty and Colt nearly cost them all their relationship. Noah and Bella got caught in a rain storm leaving them with some injuries. But the kids were alright but Connor was another story.

Living with Connor was tough for Ty and Miranda but they were finding their footing.  Miranda and Ty got some wonderful unexpected news that they wanted to share with the family in Kentucky. Before reaching their destination, they encountered someone from Miranda's past.

Miranda was happy when no one from Tucker's family didn't make the effort to know Isabella. So when she saw Tucker's mother talking to Bella, all her hatred for the woman came back tenfold.

When Ty and Miranda were faced with the possibility of losing their daughter Izzy, they did everything in their power to make sure that didn't happened. In the process they nearly lost their family when someone from Ty's past didn't get the hints that he didn't want anything to do with that say person.

Jackson & Jacob Mitchell aka Jax & Jake were born prematurely, loved how the Mitchell family always came together and were each other's pillars when in crisis. Connor was doing much better in NC and didn't want to head back to Kentucky.

When Ty found himself in trouble, Connor did everything to make sure that his sister didn't lose her family nor marriage. He got the proof that Ty never tainted his wedding vows.

Wrapping Up

The Michells was gonna spend their Thanksgiving at Colt and Savanna's. Having the whole gang together has always been a must with the Mitchells.

At times it seemed like the family gathering would have to be moved to another location but thankfully everything worked out in the end.

The Christmas gathering was at Ty and Miranda's, other than Miranda obsessing about what was going on between her boss Amy and her brother Conner. Things went smoothly. And as always, Izzy had Ty wrapped around her little finger.

THE MITCHELL FAMILY SERIES VOLUME 1-4.5 box set was beautifully written, loved all the curves that were thrown the heroes and heroines' way.

These are the longest books that Iris has written and she takes more time to develop her characters.  Copper and Marla are different from any other couple Iris has created in her contemporary romances.  Copper is rough and tough and downright scary if someone gets on his ""bad"" side and yet he's so enamored with Marla that he does everything he can to keep from frightening her or making her uncomfortable.  Copper and Marla have been acquaintances for four years while Marla's sister works for the Metal Cowboys as their assistant in their custom motor cycle business.  Additionally, Marla has been attracted to Copper the whole time her sister has worked for him.  However, because of a traumatic event earlier in her life, Marla is determined to keep her distance from Copper for her own peace of mind.  Of course, life conspires to throw them together in such a way that Marla has to muster the courage to admit her attraction to Copper and share with him what happened to her earlier in life.  Copper makes it his mission in life to not only protect Marla and make a certain someone pay for what's been done to Marla - he's also determined to show her how good that can be together.

4381,5,A2G57I48SVN31M,B00M9ST3FO,"If you're looking for a fun and light read then this probably isn't your book. This novel is filled with heavy information that will leave you thinking days after youve finished reading it.  Of course, the novel starts out on a lighter note with gambling and a kid just trying to get a little fast cash, but soon after things take a turn that will leave you glued to the pages.
The writing in this novel is impeccable. The author managed to get the 60s vibe down well, which helped make the story come to life even more. I even loved that it took place in San Diego, which made me feel pretty homesick.
I feel as if Ive learned a lot by reading this novel, which always makes me happy. The author certainly put a lot of thought and research into his tale, which is obvious straight away. Id recommend this to anyone who loves historical fiction or books with a dark edge.",A must read!!,2,9/16/2016
4382,5,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00M9ST3FO,"California author sports writer/aerospace scientist/professional poker player, and real estate investor Scott Spade describes himself as an eclectic neuroscience professor whos passion is exploring information buried beneath conventional wisdom in scientific, political, military and economic systems. His entry into the literary world was through his scientific book: BLACKS BEACH PARALLAX is his first novel. The reader will discover the fact that Scotts broad experience and inquisitive mind and nature all are quite evident in this, his debut fiction novel.

A reminder: Parallax is the apparent displacement of an observed object due to a change in the position of the observer. The title is most apt for this probing novel. Scott takes a chance by opening his story with a letter written in 2038 by main character Jack OMalley to his grandson Michael (Associate Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience) at Jacks death. Your recent groundbreaking research on the effects of a new class of drugs on human behavior is sure to attract government attention. The CIA or some other agency may offer you financial support to carry out more directed drug studies. I cannot advise you on how to respond; options must be weighed carefully The enclosed manuscript relates my experiences during the period of 1962 1982; several questions are addressed. Who started the shadowy company Integrated Parallax Systems? How did it gain access to government secrets, many not known even to the president? Who was the mysterious character known as the Colonel, and what really happened to him? Do secret government programs employ mind-altering drugs? How many media pundits are paid under the table to do their bidding?... and so on. A brilliant way to pull the reader into this epic novel.

Add to this the authors note from the books cover: This work of historical fiction accurately represents pivotal global events of the period 1962-1975. The CIA programs, MKUltra, Midnight Climax, Mongoose and Phoenix have been disclosed in official congressional investigations. In Operation Mockingbird leading American journalists were (and perhaps still are) paid secretly to promote the CIA's views in the mainstream media. The illegal FBI actions of CONTELPRO under J. Edgar Hoover against peaceful war protestors are also well documented. We don't know if Hoover's avoidance of action against organized crime was due to homosexual blackmail, or if he was just overly friendly with the mob-connected plutocrats. Scott even includes many photographs that enhance the period aspect of the work.

The synopsis is long but worth of quoting  When Jack graduates from college he has no inkling of the strange events that will soon dominate his life. Fired from his job at Astro Dynamics, Jack turns to San Diegos poker parlors to pay his bills. Jacks adventures span a curious spectrum of politics, life, love, and sex in the 1960s counterculture. Jacks close friend Gene takes a job with the mysterious organization Integrated Parallax Systems. When Gene and his boss, a shadowy figure known only as the Colonel, uncover top secret government programs, Jacks carefree life turns deadly. Jacks personal life evolves in parallel with his undercover activities. His perspectives change as he matures and becomes entangled in the counterculture. Jack acquires a deeper understanding of the American political system and the pivotal events of the time, challenging long held beliefs. Experimental social arrangements like group living and open relationships become common. Jack shuns soul-killing jobs; soundly rejecting the lives of quiet desperation so vividly expressed by Thoreau, and seeks inventive income sources to support an unconventional lifestyle.
Jacks adventures connect him to an odd cast of charactersgambling engineers, seductive secretaries, slick poker players, innovative social workers, nude dancers, Swiss bankers, secret government operatives, shrewd investors, karate experts, sexual freedom advocates, sleazy bar patrons, and veiled CIA agents. Greater San Diego provides the main venue for this work of historical fiction. The story line accurately depicts global events of the period 19621975, including inflation of the military-industrial complex, Cuban missile crisis, assassination of President Kennedy, and Vietnam War. Reckless actions by US military and political leaders are revealed, actions that come within a hairs breadth of causing Americas destruction. Jacks adventures unfold in a curious collection of settingsAstro Dynamics, Vandenberg Air Force Base, Bicycle Bills card room, Sandstone Ranch, Credit Suisse, Atascadero Mental Hospital, Blacks Beach, Lesters karate gym, and the Body Shop. These are (or were at the time) real places, accurately depicted by an author-witness who was there. The narrative also feeds on known CIA programs that have since been disclosed either in official congressional investigations or as a consequence of the US Freedom of Information Act. Further disclosures continue to this day, but they are forcibly resisted by entrenched interests. In Operation Mockingbird leading American journalists were (and perhaps still are) paid secretly to promote the CIA's views in the mainstream media. The FBIs unconstitutional actions of CONTELPRO under J. Edgar Hoover against Vietnam War protestors provide another part of the story line.

This is a startlingly fine debut novel by an obvious gifted scholar who just happens to write exceedingly well. Intense, but very highly recommended. Grady Harp, September 16",He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past. - George Orwell,2,9/9/2016
4383,3,A3A7FF87LEVCQ1,B00MARJTYO,"A quickly spreading virus is turning the people of Austin into irrational flesh-craving horrors and in this introductory box set (the story continues for at least six more installments) Zed and his new associates attempt to stay alive, understand their enemy, and secure food and shelter.  Zed is a ""slow burn,"" which means he has the virus but it hasn't damaged his brain.  Physically he has changed, but emotionally and mentally, he's still himself.  This causes social complications (he looks like a zombie), but also benefits (the zombies often mistake him for one of their own).

The story has a lot of repetition.  Although the plot seems to move very quickly in some parts (it takes less than a day for the characters to decide the human civilization is over), Zed's first person narration often seems to be stuck on a loop of repeating the same information and thoughts.  Fans of the genre may enjoy this twist on the zombie concept, but this was just too repetitious for me.",Too much repetition,3,1/12/2017
4384,5,A3KICZEOL3T497,B00MARJTYO,"I am a big fan of this author and decided to try this Slow Burn series and I'm glad I did because the author puts a spin on Zombies that no other author has done.  The main characters are developed very well and right away you want to root for Zane and Murphy.  They start off as dregs  of society and prove to be society's only hope.  Some other developing characters who just start to connect with, well, they get killed, turned or eaten.  The story moves right along and doesn't waste a lot of time over-describing things.  The author added so much chaos and turmoil that the reader almost gives up hope on any of the characters surviving, but there's always that one piece you didn't think about that creates a viable escape - or not.  My only concern is continuing the story for so long - I think the author is on Book 9.  I'm not sure I have the wallet, gusto or time to keep reading up to 9 books.  Again, I'm a hugh fan of this author and have read most of his published books.  This story is worth the time and effort to read the first 3 books which is over 600 pages.

4386,5,ASALXVFHVLR6W,B00MARJTYO,"I read all 9 books in the series in about 3 weeks, and yes, I am an adult.  Also, although I enjoy a zombie movie now and then, I am not a hardcore zombie fan, but I couldn't put these books down.  Heres why:

First of all, it is a testament to the authors skill that he is able to write these books in the first person point of view.  As I read the first few paragraphs I considered stopping right there because first person is severely limiting and is not done well nearly as often as it is attempted.  But by the time I read a few more paragraphs, I was hooked.  I read the nine books essentially non-stop.

Second, the main character is relatable, not so much because of his personal history pre-zombie times but because of how he thinks of himself, generally speaking.  Hes a guy with a few emotional scars and a few strengths, and hes just trying to find a place in the world.  Now that the world has been zombie-fied, things get a bit more dramatic than before.

Third, the whole slow burn concept is a great twist on the whole zombie setting, one that I cant recall being used in any other zombie story, ever. Fourth, the authors inventiveness surfaces over and over again, in clever and surprising ways.  I don't think there was a clich or even a slightly tired scene in any of the 9 books.  I won't give anything away here, but youll see what I mean when he figures out how to refuel a piece of farm equipment.

Fifth, the author knows a few things about animal behavior, which he applies to the zombies.  Clue: various groups of zombies exhibit radically different behaviors.

Sixth, the pacing is great.  Something is either happening or about to happen, and nowhere in the books does the author bore you with useless exposition. Seventh, the dialogue is done well.  Different characters sound like different people, and even in quiet scenes they talk like people exhausted and stressed in a world gone wacky, not like characters in a soap opera or half-baked sitcom.  Oh, and there are some rather funny lines throughout the books.

Lastly, there are human interactions and emotions and growth that just happen to take place in the middle of some very wild zombie craziness.  Long after you read these books, you WILL remember the main characters.

So, all in all, the Slow Burn series is VERY nicely done.  Ive told a bunch of people about these books, and only when I do that do I give a book 5 stars.",VERY nicely done!,10,6/29/2016

WHY? More is written about the author than what is contained in this book (if you do a word count, it is literally, VERY close.) Book 3: Yoga poses, with a special encore performance of the ABC's of meditation poetry! Seriously, the poses are informative and helpful. The poetry...really needs to be burned. It's terrible.

In this case, You have book one, that gives you some generally good information and pointers, games, etc. but the information feels like too much an overview. Like going to a restaurant that smells of fabulous BBQ steak only to get a McD's burger.  Is it meat? Sure. Is it what it promised it would be? Not so much. The second book is a book of mindfulness, but is really a layman's version of mindfulness. I suppose if you have no other experience with the concept of mindfulness in the clinical sense, this may be okay. And while I'm griping about something so simple, I would like to add that this is for memory improvement. So, I'm not certain I understand why this book was put in here. The third book is primarily tossed together as at first, a nutritional recommendation for brain health. Not a bad thing to have, but then it just sort of throws information that is also good for you at you. Like going to the doctor for a cough and having the doctor tell you to lose weight. Yes, losing weight is good for you...but what does it have to do with the cough? Take if for what it is. None of the information in this seems to be damaging, but it isn't really cohesive in it's presentation of the topic.

Methods: Common sense ideas. Couponing, Budgeting,Repurposing, Upcycling, Eliminating unnecessary expenses.

Honestly, this book seems to be just a giant compilation of google search results.  Each book is written by a different author, and this doesn't help the book in any way to have different authors for each ""book""/section.  In the second book, the author starts pretty much bashing religious people, and saying that its our fault for people thinking an apocalypse is coming.  She also uses the word ""persons"" very often.  She blames Christians and the ""North American Ancestors"" for thinking the Devil will take their belongings away.

I especially loved the third installment, which was Homesteading and self sufficiency guide for beginners.  A step by step guide to growing your own food for self sufficiency.

As someone with a burning desire to own hens. her in depth and on point information was invaluable.  She gave good explainations and examples on food to shelter and combating all that goes a long with it.

The second book

Prepping : the ultimate survival guide - the guide to surviving any disaster
Written by Eliza Plum

For me personally this book offered a wealth of knowledge and first hand experience on what is needed in disasters and how to get through it.  I thought I had a pretty good understanding of what to keep on hand to get us through most everything. This book covered a lot more than what my basic understanding was.  It has caused me to rethink my stock piling and survival kits.  Really glad I read this.

The first book

Self Sufficiency:  Getting back to basics
How to live off the grid.  by Terence A. Williams.

This was a very basic read for me, covering a wide variety of general topics.  A good place to start if you are giving this kind of lifestyle some thought.  I kind of got hung up on leaving chapter 3 which was about living frugally, on to chapter 4 which talks about repurposing.  The author speaks of collecting toilet paper rolls, I was thinking for purposes such as stuffing with dryer lint for fire starters etc, but no it was to make decorative art from.  Which is cool, but I was wondering how it sort of fit with the gist of the collection.  The one thing I really had trouble with was, touting frugality in the previous chapter to then going on to mention that he goes through around 1000 bottles of water a year.  Being environmentally conscious and in the fit of sustainability would we not be skipping purchasing bottled water and filtering our own and using a stainless steel or glass water bottle be more earth friendly and frugal.  Sadly that is the one thing I took from the book and just couldn't get past.

4394,5,A2JUB6V2VP6LVU,B00MAXC3SW,"Ketosis /ktoss/ is a metabolic state where most of the body's energy supply comes from ketone bodies in the blood, in contrast to a state of glycolysis where blood glucose provides most of the energy. (Wikipedia) . So for dieting it makes common sense -- when you eat carbs, those are burned for energy and the fat deposits in your body are not used -- but if you starve yourself (cut down on the total you are eating especially of carbs) , then the body mechanisms will switch to releasing fat into the blood stream to be burned as energy -- the basic idea on ketonic diets is to cut down on carbs but avoid starvation cramps by substituting protein for the carbs you might have eaten. This Ketonic Diet boxed set (mine was Kindle version) is 3 separate books - Costar touched on the Atkins, South Beach and other diets, and then wrote extensively about the Dukan Diet, a modified Ketonic 4-stage diet popular especially in France; Michaels wrote on the more traditional ketonic diet, initially designed at the Mayo clinic in the 1920's to help epileptic children, and Calderon wrote on the Mediterranean diet (it's not just fresh foods, fish, and olive oil found near the Mediterranean but active exercise lifestyle too), and the low-Thyroid diet ( avoid cruciferous foods like broccoli  but otherwise varied high nutritional). It's loaded with delicious recipes, both to use as-is and as a starting point for your own creations. In some, allowed foods include alcohol, artificial sweeteners and some natural sweets - others are more restricted. The point is made, and it's very clear when you read, that this is not a casual game -- check with your doctor before and during especially the more rigorous diets -- the farther you are from well-balanced variety, the more risk for damaging your metabolism or organs.

4395,5,A3IE9UQ3PQMO09,B00MAXC3P0,"This digital box set presents a concise combination of personal experience and research, which I like. I would much rather read a book from someone who has walked the walk, than someone simply theorizing based on research and the experiences of others.

Homesteading, by common usage, has gone from meaning ""living completely off the grid"" to being a catch-all term for patterns of self-sufficient, frugal, self-reliant behavior. This set contains tips every average American could benefit from, regardless of whether or not they wanted to fully embrace the lifestyle. The author immediately presents a more balanced and realistic view of self-sufficiency, within the first few pages. We do not strive to be fully sufficient - living completely free of each other and resources. Instead, self-sufficiency has by common usage come to mean one's personal definition of providing for their own material means in a way that is as free from ""the grid"" - the resources of contemporary society - as much as possible. For one family, this may mean planting a vegetable garden and harvesting rain water to provide for it, or raising chickens or bees to lower their food costs and impact. For another individual, this may mean creating a self-sufficient one-acre farm. The author does a good job of reassuring the reader that self-sufficiency is not a race or a strict definition and that we can all implement steps toward our personal goals.

As for further content, content that I especially appreciated in the first volume were homemade cleaning supplies - many of which I've already personally implemented, including using old cloths instead of paper towels for cleaning and using homemade laundry and dishwasher soap. Repurposing items, paring down your budget and financial expenditures, and general frugality tips round out the first book. Overall, it's a great introduction into light self-sufficiency terminology and practice, very useful for anyone interested in the ideas.

The second volume is a little more hardcore - Prepping. I myself have not yet dove into prepping. It's a daunting task with a family of seven with many pets! This book has good tips for anyone new to the idea of prepping. As I've done a lot of research without yet taking the leap, it's all consistent information from what I've read elsewhere, which speaks to the authenticity of the author's research. From water supply to food storage, it covers things well. As a Mormon, I know a bit about food storage and this book hits the mark in that regard. It definitely encouraged me to start canning items that we could use in the event of an emergency.

The medication storage section is especially appreciated, as my husband and I are both on several life-sustaining medications and knowing how we can safely stock pile and store emergency supplies of our most vital medications is important.

The third book is my favorite... Growing your own food for self-sufficiency! I am already planning my BIG veggie garden for this summer so this book in particular is going to be a huge help for me. The language in this part of the book is almost poetic and makes me excited to install our raised beds so we can enjoy the process of growing our own delicious food. It details the ins and outs of how to plan a successful garden very succinctly. The author's clear passion for the topic shines through every sentence, making this book a major winner in this box set. It also details keeping chickens for their eggs! As a former and hopefully future chicken owner, I can confirm that the info in this book is in line with what local farmers have taught me about raising chooks.

Overall, these books are hugely useful to me as an aspiring, marginally more self-sufficient individual. The tips in here will help benefit my family as I refer back to it as time goes on and I work to enact more of these tips into our lives!

So naturally having a few good low carb cookbooks on hand is great.

I like these low carb cookbooks because they have a TON of great recipes. There are really no recipes that I've found with obscure or hard to locate ingredients. Everything you make from these cookbooks can be bought at Wal-Mart, Publix, Albertsons, etc. Not only that, but there are some genuinely tasty and helpful recipes. My favorites so far have been mostly the ones with eggs (because I never quite know what to do with eggs). There are all sorts of meals and snacks for every occasion, and even picky eaters will get a kick out of some of these recipes. They're simple and the ingredients used in them are fairly low priced.

One thing to note (and the reason I don't feel comfortable giving this 5 stars) is that these book tout the benefits of ""body confusion"" (aka eating some things one week and not the next to ""confuse"" your body). ""Body confusion"" is a disproved theory that is not based in actual science and I don't feel entirely comfortable supporting it. If you can skip past the first few chapters about confusing your body though, there are decent recipes that will taste delicious.

I feel good about having the boxed set of these low carb cookbooks. Now I have even more recipes to make for my hubby that are yummy, cheap, and guilt-free.

You may think that the author of this book shall include this technique or I can do a better technique or practice than the ones referred on this book, but I can honestly tell you this, do you remember when you had little or no knowledge about Yoga and its related concepts?

Perhaps you have forgotten where you come from, but if you follow the simple routines explained on this book, you will be able to keep in mind your origins, understand where you come from and understand where you want to go now.

The books seemed like they were thrown together into this set and don't flow very well between one another and actively contradict information and recommendations in each other.
The first book ""Is it time for a Sugar Detox?"" is by Lisa Patrick.  The writing in this book was easy to read, flowed fairly easily, and read like a friend giving you some information.  It wasn't too scientific and didn't require a lot of extra thought.  This book recommends removing all sugar, including natural sugars such as fruits for the initial detox period.  It falls short on further explanation of how long you should detox in which stages and doesn't provide any meal plans or recipes.  It does provide good information about diseases that are affected by excess sugar and the detriments of a high sugar diet.
The second book is ""Detox Recipes"" by Anita Bates.  This book provides details regarding the benefits of sugar detoxing, but allows for artificial sweeteners and fruit.  This book is full of recipes and the final chapter includes a meal plan.  The recipes are not overly complex and use a variety of basic ingredients as well as some new ingredients.
The third book focuses on colon cleanses.  It provides information into different types of colon cleanses (I had no idea there were so many kinds), information on benefits of each type of cleanse.  There were a number of grammatical errors that took away from the book overall.  Further explanation would be beneficial for at home colon cleanses.
Overall, lots of scattered information that doesn't necessarily fit together well, isn't very cohesive and is in some ways contradictory.  Not  bad way to get some beginning information before searching for more detailed books about the detox of your choice.

Jane finds herself questioning everything from Irene s cause of death, to how well she really knew her after all. I was very amused by all of Janes antics as she searches for answers while toting along Sexy Beast, Irenes poodle.

I have long been searching for books that could make me laugh out loud in the way the early Stephanie Plums did. This book came close and truth be told, I actually liked Jane as a person more than I liked Stephanie. Way more introspection.  I am very much looking forward to getting to know her better.  I was pretty sure I nailed the killer early on and yes, it turned out I was right, but there were so many twists and turns and so much charm that I didn't really mind.

4448,4,AVWO66KYBZN9M,B00MD5VDNS,"I tend to shop the free and discounted aisle at Kindle and find more than a few gems among some truly deplorable and poorly proofread books..  This was one - the first in a series about, Jane Delaney, aka the Death Diva, who makes a living doing strange things for, and often to, the dearly departed.  Granted, it isn't much of a living, but it keeps her afloat while she watches her ex-husband run through a series of wives while amassing a fortune from a company he named for her.  By the way, she is still in love with him.

None of this, career or love-life, seems likely to make Jane a happy woman, but she remains cheerful albeit sarcastic (love that in a character) and pretty self aware.  While attempting, and failing, to pull off her latest funeral-related assignment she finds her most frequent customer rather dead and herself in a maze of that customer's family secrets.

Murder aside, it is a fun read.  The book was also laid out nicely and better proof-read than 90 percent of Kindle books.  I look forward to reading the other three books in the series.",One of Those Kindle Gems,4,6/3/2017

4456,5,AQFF452SVDF48,B00MD5VDNS,"The heroine of this book is unlike any that I have read before.  Jane Delaney is the 'Death Diva,' a woman who specializes in doing things that other people would never do but want someone else to do for them.  Examples:  Loading someones ashes into shotgun shells,  being a 'professional mourner' at a funeral, or stealing a broach from the body of an elderly woman at a funeral home.  The last one mentioned is a focal point of this story.  Jane is sent to retrieve a broach for her elderly client, Irene.  Irene has been a friend and employer for 20 years and Jane wants to accomplish this for her.  Unfortunately, as she is about to nab the treasure, a priest beats her to it!  This book takes the reader on a roller coaster ride as Jane searches for the broach, tries to solve a possible murder, and track down a kidnapper.  And all the while caring for a slightly neurotic and completely adorable poodle named Sexy Beast.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the author's writing style.

Well that and the $300 payout promised for the return of the brooch. However a lot goes wrong when a priest comes behind her just as she was about to steal the pin, and she allows him to go ahead of her. You can probably guess what happened next! But nothing made me prepared for the sudden death and the mystery involved!

Janey is a true friend, and is shocked when the will is read and she has inherited the dog (Sexy Beast) and the house of her recently deceased friend. Now more than ever she is determined to prove that she was murdered, and did not die of a simple heart attack!

The planet chosen had been colonized over two hundred years ago. Their first objective is to find out what happened to the prior colony. Along with 500 colonists, Tiger Lilly, and her team are left on the planet.  Their team soon discovers a large man in his thirties, Conley.

Tiger Lily is attracted to him upon sight. Conley is equally fixated. Fortunately, he speaks a broken English, so they are able to communicate.
Dangers abound in this world, and frankly, Im not sure they would have survived if not for Conley and his very large sword. At first, his broken English makes him seems a bit slow, but when danger arrives (which it does often) he responds with extreme speed.

As they quiz Conley about his society, they discover a world where princesses rule and men are second class citizens.  I have to say I loved the flip of roles from our world.  And if you take in all women on Earth, then we still remain second class citizens. So did I like the new worlds solution? Not at all. As we find out, Princesses are no better than men ruling. Something in the middle proves best of all.

There is so much to love about this book. Aurora Springer is one of the best world builders Ive ever read. Instead of assuming all will be the same on another habitable planet, even if the planet superficially appears much like ours, shell create changes that make.s a huge difference in the animal.

Unequivocally, Hodge brilliantly showcases her matchless storytelling skills in a short story leaving seasoned peers in the dust with their overly winded tomes.

Hodge is a bona fide genius when it comes to fusing sidesplitting laughter, sparkling mystery and good old-fashioned storytelling.

Hodges characters, dialogue and locale are amusing, irresistible and razor-sharp. In a nutshell, Hodges novella is a trifecta of perfection!

4473,4,A2KQPQZX4E08Z0,B00MHT0NE0,"I read this book as a stand alone because I did not know the series followed the main character. I don't think that I missed anything major by not reading the first book, (though I do plan to go back and read it). Knowing that the story continues in book three helps me with the ending of this book.
I liked the characters. I felt they were pretty realistic. There was a lot of drama going on. Everyone had issues and it seemed that Bethany was smack in the middle of each of them. A couple of the characters were pretty selfish. I thought they brought a lot of their problems on all by themselves. I would have liked to see Bethany say no and mean it with them. The ending killed me. I think that was because I had thought each book in the series was a stand alone. Thinking that way left me with burning questions. Now that I know I may get some answers in the next book, I can handle that ending.
I did enjoy the book. It held my attention. I cared about the characters. I would tell people that it is a book with loads of drama. It can be exhausting if you don't expect it. If you like drama, though, you will probably enjoy this series.","Drama, Drama, Drama",2,6/13/2016
4474,2,A1LOSPUIGUJ6G5,B00MHT0NE0,"I was not very impressed by this book. The primary character does not strike me as very genuine. She has massive self worth issues, clings desperately to her romantic interest, yet challenges a rather aggressively gruff single father? She does this to the extent that she not only pushes herself into their lives, but seems out aid to investigate them and confronts the father with the knowledge gained? Yes, I can see her identifying with a child that is overweight and who has security issues, I can even see her becoming involved with the child, but I just do not see this character, as written, confronting. It did not ring true. What did ring true was her clinging to the romantic interest, despite the signs he was not as invested. Though again, there were things that jarred, like her insistence and pushing him to do things. All told, I struggled with reading this one, and could not form an attachment to the characters. Sadly, that includes the daughter, who not only needed loving guidance with her food issues, but also needed some real discipline for her behavior - lying, pushy, whinging, defiance. It is unreasonable to me that the adults in her life allowed the behaviors without any correction.

4483,5,A2NJSWZOKLQJ5L,B00MHUT17E,"I picked up this book because it was free, and said the world had been decimated by a virus.  I was confused when weather & climate change played such a big part - the author waits until about halfway in to explain that for decades the climate change had been getting worse before the government sat up & took notice.  Then it took a couple more decades to implement infrastructure change to deal with the bad storms.  Those changes (like putting power plants & running wires underground; building storm shelters in train stations, schools, large buildings, etc.) is what allows settlements like High Meadow to grow.

Scientists created biobots - originally out of grief, to replace a lost daughter.  Biobots are human, but are built and then ""awakened"" as adults.  The creators then pour knowledge into them.  Of course the govenment and corporations want them to all be geniuses, but they are basically slaves and that drives some of them crazy, leading to murders.  A ""mad scientist"" creates a virus to kill the biobots - but it ends up killing half of the world's population at the same time.  The virus mutates each year, killing more people and animals.

Those that are left band together - some in med centers, like High Meadow.  How does mankind survive when we have lost the people who used to know how to grow things, how to make things?

I like the fact that each chapter starts with a sentence or two from a book about the history of the world since Year Zero - written by the man who is the leader of High Meadow.  It explains and examines the world our characters live in, without a huge ""data dump"".  I loved the two characters at the center of most of the action - Nick, an FBI agent in the old world, and a biobot named Whisp who has a form of ESP where he can sense people - find them if they are lost; judge their emotions.

Ms Sabo wrote a very interesting novel here, done in short tight chapters which in itself is unique as it is satisfying. She builds her story slowly but steadily, the action is there but is never over done. The two main characters, Nick and Wisp, are both very well written; and the supporting characters do just that - support a very interesting story where no one has all the facts of what exactly is going on anymore. High speed bullet trains still run, food is still distributed, vaccines are produced every year and distributed, all works until it doesn't.

I was looking forward to Sir Falcons and Queen Sonyas story.  Ive loved him from the beginning; his honour, his patience and his dedication.  And Sonya, a warrior Queen, dangerous, seductive and sexy (and in this instance, the heroine was not a virgin  yay, go 21st century!), Ive always wanted them to get together.  But for me the story was ruined.  Im a slow, methodical reader.  I read every word.  And when, in the heat of the moment, I have to interpret the authors meaning because words used are incorrect or missing, the narration becomes rather clunky and it gets very annoying.

Dont get me wrong, Amanda has created a rollicking yarn and Im truly on board with all the characters and the world shes put them in, but the story suffers and I don't like that its let down by an oversight such as this.

Will I be forgiving enough to read a further story?  Im not sure.  I really want to know whats going on with Gabriel.  Will he rescue the lovely Jordan from the clutches of the diabolical Boras before he makes her a bleeder; and with Silvie, the Shaw Priestess, and the hunky vampire, Gannon, who is forbidden to her because all Shaw women in such position must remain chaste (yeah, right  how archaic).  Of course I want to know how she manages to get around this stipulation.  So yeah, I probably will. And I know very few manuscripts are perfect, the odd word error or misuse in the context they're (there, their) written.  Im not a grammar fiend, Im not expecting perfection.  I would, however, in this instance appreciate a little more respect as a reader and someone who is paying money (although, of course if Im honest, these books are not expensive  but does that really matter?) for these books to receive a little more editorial attention before they grace the sellers bookshelves.",Not a grammar fiend usually but this is just getting too much...,2,4/2/2016

4506,4,A3PD7G89QO7937,B00ML6B4OC,"I don't believe in a sapient or sentient god or that you spend eternity being rewarded or punished for 80 or so years of actions. In fact, Im anti religious, especially when it comes to the Abrahamic religions - I believe everyone has a right to their beliefs, as long as they don't push them on others- however the Abrahamic religions' drive seems to be to push their way on others.
So as you can imagine, I was extremely apprehensive about this series. Im about halfway through the 2nd book and am very pleased to say its not preachy at all, nor does it shove any religious morality at you. It reads like a sci fi or fantasy as if it took the Abrahamic mythos and created a story using a general outline of the mythos, slightly altered. Kind of like ""On a Pale Horse"" by Piers Anthony uses a lot of Christian mythos about heaven and hell and the afterlife, but in a non religious way, or Isis Wept tells the story of Isis and Osiris in novel form.
 So far, theres no mention of God or Jesus or any of the typical stuff youd expect. Just angels and humans, and the angels are not perfect divine beings. They are fallable, make mistakes, do things they shouldnt. They are very well written. They have genders as well, although it seems to be more about physical appearance then anything else, although two troubled angels start feeling physical attraction and have (not graphic) sex with each other for the first time in existence.
The story in a nutshell - the choir (type/duty) of angels who judges the souls of the newly dead gets twisted and wants to make everything perfect. In order to do so, they are going to break the seven seals to destroy the Earth so there will be no more souls to judge, as they view all humans as tainted. What they don't realize is that the End Times destroys all creation, not just humans. In their misguided attempt, they frame the leader of the angels, Michaela, an Archangel, for a crime she didn't commit and rip her wings off and cast her to earth. They also throw the entire choir of Archangels (warrior angels and the leaders) to Earth and make a deal with Lucifer -he can have Hell and the earth if they get Heaven. Of course, Lucifer being Lucifer he has his own plans to take over all of creation. Michaela is trapped on earth, framed for a crime she didn't commit and must try and stop Lucifer and the bad choir before reality itself breaks apart. She meets Clark, a punk human who is the son of the leader of the Decendents of Enoch, a clan of humans who are sworn to assist and guard the angels when they perform earthly duties. There is also many other beings from Abrahamic mythos, as well as a few other culture's myth. For instance, the Nephilim are the decendents of angels called Watchers and humans, Watchers are a punished Choir with powerful sorcery who are locked helpless in a cave for taking humans as wives, Loki is an angel who collects the dead, Sirens are the wives of the Watchers who were punished by being able to entrance men with their voice but not touch them and many other fallen angels, demons, and so on-beings familiar to anyone who knows anything about human myth.

The imagery is awesome, and the descriptions of the angels, duties, places, beings, magic is really well done.
The series is worth a read, even if (like me) you aren't Christian. Dont let the fact that its uses a lot of a certain belief's mythos keep you away. Its a scifi/fantasy novel that happens to be about angels fighting a spiritual war, not a book about a religion.","A good series, even for an agnostic",3,6/4/2016

He happen to be in a town where his ex wife (aka heroine) and daughter lives for a rodeo competition. He has an accident and loses some of his memory. He thinks he is still married to the h.

They had divorced 6 years earlier because his first priority was winning rodeo competitions and hanging with friends. He was always on the road and spent little time with his wife. The last straw for him was when she got pregnant. He had no contact with the heroine or his daughter in the six years they were apart. He dutifully sent child support checks and smexed a lot with other women.

The h shares a lot with him showing him the man he had become regarding his family to jumpstart his memory. It is kind of like the ghost of Christmas past in the Scrooge.

Two things I really hated about the book. One, the hero was really less than a hero by not realizing the family he lost and did not initiate the second chance. Two, I thought that the h was too much of a doormat to let him get away with no groveling after he gets his memory back. I also hated that there was the other woman that shows up while he is trying to regain memory. She was his current girlfriend. She offers to jog his memory in the bedroom. It didn't seem like he gave much thought to h at all or regret their time apart.

Tom Farrell had a crush on Darcy Donovan from the first time he had seen her.  She was absolutely gorgeous and her heart seemed to match her looks.  However, she was his friends girlfriend so he had to back off.  After a fiasco with his own girlfriend and when Nick began harassing Darcy, Tom decided it was time to make his own move.

A few twists and tunes, and the characters are pretty well developed. There are a few parts that could be edited slightly better, but I do know most authors on here prefer for their readers to help them out in this aspect.
It was not hard reading by any means, but it was also not an elementary level book. Be prepared for some love scenes. But honestly, sometimes they do add to the storyline, right?
I hope to either purchase more in this series (if there is one) or get the author motivated to write more! Not that this was left with just a cliffhanger or anything, I have just loved how the storyline was developed, and would love to know where this could head into the future. Knowing how the characters have developed, interacted, and have grown leaves me with a lot of hope for more. I always love series/ books where there is a spin- off into a similar setting, but with acquaintances that the characters had, or will have.

Olivia Canaday, the FMC, has a fear of riding horses after getting a kick that ended her equestrian career, which also leads to her bitter divorce with her husband, but she can't stay away from the horses, so she turned into horse rescue / therapy horse / riding lesson business, as long as she didn't have to get on the saddle herself.  However, with little additional training, she did the full English equestrian demonstration with no problems when her student came down with appendicitis.

Jake Lassen, the MMC, had PTSD and survivor's guilt from his mission in Afghanistan when his chopper was shot down and several people were killed, but he had no problem doing business deals and fly helo for tours.

The only problem for them to fall in love was her bitter fight with her ex, who showed up for ONE scene (to ruin her birthday) and was basically chased out of town by Jake (with a couple complimentary knuckle sandwiches as a parting gift).

This story grabbed me right from the start and pulled me right into the story. I liked the fact that Olivia had a very supportive family, but one that wasn't about to let her sit around and feel sorry for herself forever. So many times you read stories about how mean the step-fathers and sisters are, but that's not the case in this story....and I have to say I found that very refreshing. I also like the fact that Jake and Olivia were best friends for many years before they took it to the next level. And even then; they didn't rush into anything major without thinking it all through, to make sure it was the right thing to do. I loved Deke and how accepting he was of Olivia. You could feel just how protective he was about his Nephew, but with good reason. Jake had been through so much already with the loss of his parents, and the PTSD caused from his years in the military....and the major accident that made him finally opt out.

This author did a great job of making these characters seem so real and believable. And the story was so well written that it just flowed so effortlessly.

I suffer from several autoimmune diseases and hypermobility, and yoga is a great way to strengthen the muscles I need to support my bones and joints and prevent them from overextending. My 5 year old daughter is also hypermobile and this is a great help for her as well. I've found myself wanting to tap into the spiritual nature of yoga more recently and this book is a great help for me in doing so.

The first book - Yoga poses and yoga & meditation:
I love the way the author broke down the ""rights"" of yoga BUT stresses that no matter where you are in life - obese, thin, healthy, unhealthy - you can start the practice of yoga. This all inclusive attitude is what makes yoga such a great starter exercise for anyone.

It breaks down typical relaxation poses, yoga breathing, meditation, and different yoga exercises. Very concise and complete. My only wish is that there were pictures! It also goes through other essential tips for beginners - posing, the best times of the day or your daily cycle to practice your yoga poses, dietary restrictions that should be observed. Altogether this is a great beginners' guide but it would be AWESOME if it included photos or drawings to illustrate poses and so on.

The second book - The Starter Guide:
It goes into the history behind yoga, which is really interesting stuff. I've studied world religions and the importance of yoga and most of this information jives with what I've learned in the past, so it's easy to see that the author has done extensive research. It goes in-depth into the clinically proven benefits of yoga practice, as well as how to know whether or not it's the right choice of exercise for you. It details yoga class tips and ettiquette, what to wear to be most comfortable, and so on. Very helpful tips for me, as I've been hesitant to dive into group yoga practice and perhaps this info will give me the confidence to do so. The descriptions of the yoga poses are very specific, which is helpful to a beginner.

The third book - appears to be a dictionary of yoga poses, with some pictures, which is HUGELY helpful and well-illustrated and described.

The fourth book - Meditation! Something I really need to look into further for pain management and anxiety reduction. The techniques are well-described. It details techniques and goals of meditation thoroughly. It gives a checklist of how to get started that is unintimidating and down to earth. I really look forward to putting this into practice in my everyday life.

I am a fitness instructor, teaching formats such as Zumba, Hard Core (abs), Barre, and total body conditioning formats (HIIT, etc).  I want to start doing yoga regurarly, but when I joined a mainsteam class, I felt intimidated.  I'm not super flexible and the class moved pretty fast.  It started in position one and transitioned to position two relatively quickly.  By the time they got to pose three, I was just trying to get out of pose one.

I wanted an at-home guide to various yoga moves, so:
  1.  I'll know the terminology
  2.  I will know how get into each pose properly

Tree
There are a few formatiing issues -- but overall this book is super helpful for a beginner.  I especially like that they provide variations as well as a detailed description getting into the poses.

Daily Meditation Ritual Lifestyle: Daily Ritual Secrets series.
 This was my least favorite book of the boxed set.  But then again, i'm not a meditator.  I'm not even a yogi.  This book walks one through how to get started with meditation -- finding a place, a time and duration of your meditation practice.  The book walks you through breathing, different meditation techniques and how to make meditiation a part of your daily ritual.  This book speaks on Guided meditation, proper and deep breathing, goals of meditation.  The most interesting part of this book for me, was walking meditation.  I actually appreciated this part of the book.  How to check out your surrounding while walking and appreciating/meditating on the beauty around you.

Overall --- this is a good introduction for the new yogi.

4563,4,A2WOLY23YYNGJY,B00MQDGK8A,"This was a pretty good read, although my husband and I aren't full minimalists, we have taken huge steps to reduce our usage of power, junk food intake, power usage and even let go of cable to have a Roku.
There are suggestions in these guides that I never thought of, like how to re purpose dental floss and condoms if you are ever stranded somewhere.  I know I won't be storing water in a condom because of the chemicals that go into them, but the Author has come up with ideas that others may need to use at some point.  Dental floss can be used to snare dinner.
Some frugal ideas that are mentioned are: vegetable gardening to save on buying high priced produce.  Making your own cleaners to clean the house, Recycling and actually turning in cans for cash to use on something you need, cutting your utility bill by being proactive about your wasteful habits, and receiving samples of products so you don't have to buy them all the time.
This book breaks down reasons to live a frugal lifestyle, how to be frugal financially, and other ideas that will help you begin the process towards living frugally.  My favorite chapter is how to implement clutter busting techniques.  We have a lot of difficulty, even with donating our things to charity, keeping the clutter down.  Its all about finding a place for everything and only keeping what you need.  This book is a good resource and I encourage others to read this.  I received my copy for free in exchange for an unbiased book review.  The opinion is my own and I do think this will help others begin the frugal process.",Interesting read,2,3/16/2016
4564,3,A3L7FFB771QA,B00MQDGK8A,"This is more of a large pamphlet than a book, which for the price ($0 on the kindle) is totally okay! It comes with three little ""books"" that discuss a general overview of decluttering your home and life, with the goal of simplifying and finding happiness with less. It's a good goal, and one I've pursued for most of my life, so the information wasn't too new for me. It doesn't go into great detail on how, exactly, to manage your finances or belongings, but it does give a general overview that I feel would be helpful to anyone new to frugality.

I disagree with some of the book. For instance, the author recommends not bringing anything but cash with you to the store, and always avoiding credit cards. This is good advice for impulse spenders who can't rein in a habit of overspending every time they shop, but it is absolutely terrible advice for everyone else. Credit cards not only help you build credit for larger purchases (like a home loan), but they also offer rewards, including cash back, every time you make a purchase. Using credit cards effectively reduces the cost of every purchase you make, and it's more convenient as well. That is the very definition of frugal.

Despite this, the author has an anti-credit card sentiment throughout the books, which I believe contributes to a general fear of credit cards among many people. I'm also disappointed the book discusses financial planning in some general detail, but only ever recommends budgeting and recording expenses manually, not through an automatic service like mint. After all, automatic payments are great too, but what about automatic tracking and charting of expenses? How is it more minimal and easy to enter every purchase you make into a spreadsheet every time you come home from the store?

Overall, the advice in these books is an excellent start for anyone not living frugally who wants to get their foot in the door. If you're already living frugally, I wouldn't expect to learn a lot from this collection. I'd probably recommend this book to a friend struggling with saving or decluttering their life, so overall I think it's a fine read for the right person.

I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for a review. This product is already free, so that's kind of a funny thing to have to say.","Good overview for the non-frugal, but with only a bit of detail.",2,3/23/2016
4565,5,A20Y6SVZJNW6U3,B00MQDWD0E,"This series must be read in order. The first book is The Withering Palace. The second book is Evangeline. The third book is Ever Shade. The fourth book is Ever Fire. The fifth book is Ever Winter. The sixth book is The Cursed. The seventh book is Ever Wrath. This is the eighth book. It is also considered to be the first book in a spin-off series. I can't wait to read Ever Dead!

It came as a shock to Benton that he was born into a family of powerful Elementals. Studying his family's varied history has only made him more curious about how many others like him are out there in the world. If Elementals are such an old race (like Faeries) why has he never met one? What happened to all the other Elemental families? Are they the last ones left? Will he be able to keep his family, small as it is now, safe from whatever dark forces that hunted them in the past? From the Unseelie? Will he ever feel like he belongs anywhere? Or will he always be the consummate outsider?

This is Benton's story, from his point of view. It explains his take on everything that has happened since his mother regained her memories pretty much. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to read more! I never realized how amazing a character Benton is.

This series, while a spin-off/companion series, would be lost if not read AFTER the parent series in my opinion

4567,4,A2IDS87Y786L63,B00MQDGK2G,"This boxed set is an awesome overview of how you can use food as medicine, and herbal supplements to heal the body and cure various diseases.  It will tell you what to use, but not how much of each ingredient to use.  When I read the title, Herbal Remedies, I was kinda of expecting recipes.

All the foods covered are not new to anyone who have been into natural healing and health for some time.  NO surprises.

The first book of this boxed set is Herbal Remedies from Traditional Chinese Remedies to Modern Day Cures - using Herbal cures to help common ailments. by Francis Woodburn
  This book covers the use of various herbs to cure various ailments.  Herbs covered include Hemp, pennyroyal, ginko biloba, herbal teas, st. johns wort.  The surprise for me was Basil!  Basil can be used for stress relief, respiratory problems, colds and flu, wound healing and indigestion.  At the end of the book, Francis touches on how to harvest, dry and store herbs.

The second book of this boxed set is:  Natural Remedies: simple Guide for Natural CUres - how to Heal Yourself the Natural Way by Katie O'Sullivan
  Katie writes more about food than herbs.  She speaks about the various uses of olive oil, coconut, high protein/low fat protein (eggs, low fat dairy, lean meats, tofu, and beans).  She talks extensively about the treatment and prevention of Urinary Tract Infections and natural pain relief due to Fibromayalgia.

The third book in this boxed set is:  Herbs for Health and Healing by Prem Chhatwani
  Prem speaks about the uses of CInnamon, Banaba, Ashwagandha, Ginger, Triphala, Tumeric, Garlic, and Ginseng.  Prem aslo speaks about the many uses of Hydrogen Peroxide.

In this book, one is pointed to Hulda Clark's books about curing cancer and ridding the body of parasites.  This boxed set actually includes the ingredients as well as how to take the protocol depending on the disease.  I plan to purchase Hulda Clark's book to get more in depth information.

Overall, this is  a great overview of  food as medicine.  Everything we need to heal and cure the body can be found in nature.  I wish recipes were included so I can put this knowledge to use.....

This is book 2, I didn't read book 1 yet, but the Author does give some info along the way about what happened in book one.

Apparently, Alex, our much abused heroine, is in love with Rafe from book 1, but she thinks he has been killed.
Book 2 begins with Alex being kidnapped by her  stepbrother, Zach.
He is in love with Lexi, but at the same time he abuses her mentally and sexually.  It's more like he is completely obsessed with her!  He's been sexually using her since She Was thirteen!
Zach is a sexual sadist.  He wants her any way he can get her, and he gets her in EVERY way. Zach is a Spankmeister, he's a choker, a flogger, and binder.  There is NOTHING he won't do to keep Lexi!

Zach is a big bad dude, so he over powers Lexi whenever he feels like it.  He wants her to love him, even going so far as to give her Ecstasy or LSD and taking her to bed while she's under the influence of it.

This book is quite dark, there is no consent between Zach and Lexi, he just takes her.  The book has obvious triggers for some readers.

4577,2,AT0ZT3V40YVN5,B00MRGW2EC,"Potentially good historical Regency romance derailed by some serious unpleasantness with minor characters and unbelievable actions.

SPOILER!!!!
Back story:
The heros father is desperate because the wife he adores may die in childbirth so he makes a pledge to God that he will never touch her again. He thinks if he tells her that it will negate the vow because hes a Duke and his word is more important. I honestly don't know what that was all about.

As a result, his wife who adores him goes off the rails and has affairs with anything that moves including her sons best friend and, even worse, turns her back on her son.

The H who wants his mothers love and adores his father decides to become the worst sort of rake in order to deflect the gossip of his mothers affairs.

The Hs father dies never reconciling with the mother but still loving her. We aren't even at the romance yet.

But theres more. After a letter/will reveals that the father always loved the mother and lived a life of abstinence for her, the mother decides to confess how much she loved her husband and the affairs were a way of getting his attention. Barf. She feels sorry now that her son feels so unloved because she did love him but I still don't know why she never showed him the love. That's me whining.

The affair with the best friend, who apparently has his own sad backstory, is explained that they were two damaged people (he was about 15 or 16) and the mother pretended the kid was her husband. Okay, so thats alright that you had sex with your teenage sons TEENAGE friend while your husband was alive. ICK!

And now for the heroines backstory. More familial ick and nastiness with the hs mother being blackmailed into a sexual relationship with a man who also wants the heroine. He sounds and looks an awful like Harvey Weinstein. END SPOILER....

Well done writing. The main romance was a friends to lover deal with the over-protective hero and a supposedly breath of fresh air heroine, but I couldn't care by the end.

P.S.
One of the most interesting characters was Jemma despite being on site for a couple of pages (another Duke or something's illegitimate daughter) who apparently has her own book, My Enchanting Hoyden.","Convoluted, contrived and icky backstory derails the book despite good writing.",2,1/19/2018

The romantic peak was a bit lacking, possibly because the author left it so late to tie up 4 threads (friend issue, mother issue, money issue, trust issue)...so romantic climax was muted amongst all this.

Side note: this is a book that embedded sales links and next book content immediately after last sentence...literally, as I flipped to the last page of the book, instead of satisfactorily reading the final paragraphs, my eye as grabbed by various blue sales hyperlinks and large font sales messages about another book; leaves me as a reader on a sour note, which is a shame.",A good solid romance,3,10/18/2017

Cobwebs and dust would have been everywhere.  As well as historical inaccuracies, there were spelling and word usage errors that a good editor would have corrected.  There were some some charming moments that I enjoyed and the basic plot was good.  The whole 'vow' nonsense and it's aftermath was taken to a level that was unbelievable.  I did like the hero.

In reality,  he does not trust anyone.  When his father leaves him a letter after his death, he learns that he must marry for love before his 26th birthday, or he will lose the largest part of his income.

Lady Amelia DeVere has believed herself to be too big, too gawky and too unattractive.  Deep in her heart, she has loved Charles, Baron Worthington since she was eight years old.  He treats her like a loyal dog, but she is unable to see anything but her undying hope  that someday he will realize she is intelligent and interesting and he will begin to love her.

When Phillip, Amelia's brother and Colin's best friend invites Colin to his wedding, Colin rushes to put a stop to it.  Phillip's choice of bride is a woman of bad reputation,and he deserves much better.

Colin meets Amelia and is charmed by her honesty, her lack of pretense and her inner beauty.  Through some unusual double dealing, Colin draws Phillip into a bet, and the prize is basically Amelia.  She is told of the wager, but not all the reasons for the wager.  When the wager is presented to Amelia, she believes she will be given the opportunity to change and become someone Charles will want to marry.

This is an interesting story about various kinds of love.  Colin and Phillip have the love of comrades.  Each of them would do anything they can to help the other.  There is a mother's love.  Colin's mother has damaged his life as well as her own by making bad choices.  But, she has always loved her son.  Amelia's mother has a hidden secret because she loves her children and wants to prevent them from being hurt in any manner.  Finally, there is a developing  love between a man and a woman.

As Amelia and Colin begin to know one another, they each learn that there are depths of character which take some effort to know.  Both of these people are kind hearted.  Colin has realized what a disgusting man he has become.  He is not certain he has the ability to change, and he knows he will never have the ability to love a woman.  He is unable to see what a good man he has become.

Amelia has been a loving person from the beginning of her life.  She is able to empathize with people and understand their inner pain.

The secondary characters are interesting and add to the forward movement of the story.

Of course this is a romantic story, so there are misunderstandings, things unsaid and people who attempt to interfere in true love's path.  But, this is a story of redemption and reformation and that makes it interesting.

Lady Amelia De Vere has long held 2 beliefs  1) shes not pretty and 2) shes in love with Charles, the young Lord who rescued her when she was young.
When Colin receives notice that his best friend, Phillip, is to wed he makes his way to the estate to talk him out of it.  Receiving a request from his mother he stops there first  the reason:  his beloved father left a letter to be delivered to Colin after his death and if Colin had not married by the age of 25.  A letter that states Colin must marry FOR LOVE before the age of 26 or lose all his inheritance that is not entailed.  Making his way to his Phillips estate Colin stews on this information.  Upon arriving at Phillips estate Colin realizes things have changed and the dire financial circumstances that Phillip faces.  Crafting a way to give Phillip the money he needs without Phillip refusing, Colin bets Phillip that he can polish up his sister and prove that she will become like all women  want nothing more than money and title.  If Colin wins then he pays all of Phillips debts and if Phillip wins Colin will marry Amelia (which solves his problem of a wife) and never mention giving money to Phillip again.
Amelia finds herself fascinated by her brothers friend, the cold emotionless Colin, and is extremely grateful when he fetches Phillip from the town pub where he has gone to drown his failed engagement.  After returning from a humiliating outing Amelia finds out about the wager.  At first shes totally against it  she shouldnt need false pretenses to earn the love and attention of a man.  Until she realizes this is Colins way of helping Phillip and since she has not intentions of changing she doesnt worry about Phillip losing the bet.
Oh how the seemingly simple becomes so complicated.  The more time Colin spends with Amelia the more he realizes the true goodness within her.  The more time Amelia spends with Colin the more she sees the tortured soul.  Will either one of them realize their love for the other.  If Colin does will he recognize it for what it is?  Will old fights, lurking evil, a mother willing to do anything to save her children and a mother wanting to repair her relationship with her son help or hinder their love?

Having no cash with him, he angrily deserts his purchases on the counter and leaves the store. She's recognized his name, a world famous photographer she greatly admires, and quickly pays for both their purchases, but by the time she gets outside, he's already driving away. Rushing to intercept him before he leaves, she runs into the street, arms loaded with snacks and magazines. Thankfully he doesn't run over her and, very surprised, takes her gift, well mostly, because the drinks are shifting and the glass bottle of tea slips to shatter on the pavement, followed by two of the fashion magazines which fall into the wet puddle. What a way for the girl to meet the guy?! The story continues to develop into a totally charming, sometimes angst filled saga of three lives, all scarred, that are made to meet.

The writing is very good, and the plot lines intriguing. In spite of several things I don't like: frequent sexual allusions, F-bombs, and secret government agencies that hold themselves above the law, I enjoyed the first two books enough to read the third.
That's when the series bit the dust for me.

She had given up so much of her life already to maintain this protection.  The U.S. Marshal gave her a tour of her newly provided house and background on the surrounding area.  Since billionaire Dominic Wolfe was her neighbor, the grounds were well protected.  An older lady was her other neighbor, and woods surrounded them.  This should be absolutely safe, she was told.

In the evening, Dominic wanted to run, so he shifted into his wolf and went out on the trail.  Drawn by her scent, he ran near Mias house and saw her preparing for her bath.  When he heard her crying, he wondered about the loneliness and despair in her sobs.  It seemed to him that she was running away from something or someone.

Hints of interest in BDSM were definite turn-offs for me.  I get it that alphas are dominant and expect all to submit, but Dominic was way too overbearing.  He immediately decided to take her as his pleasure pet, but to me he seemed very cold and brusque about it.  Even the seemingly kind thought of his wanting to protect her was cold once you realize it was only because she was his possession and not because he particularly cared about her safety.  But the characters were well developed and the story was well written with a good plot.  (Feeling annoyed with a character is a sign that the author's writing is definitely effective.)  I recommend this book!  I also listened to the audiobook which was excellent!  The narrator was perfect on the voices so you could tell the characters apart.

Although there was a murder involved, this is definitely a cozy mystery. At times, I found it silly and unbelievable, but I knew that going in. The dialogue varied for some reason. One minute the dialogue flowed naturally and the next it was stilted and wooden. The passages involving the police were particularly ridiculous and unrealistic.

There was A LOT of reference to Bezus beloved Nanny, Hattie. Just about every silly saying under the sun was attributed to her. There were also many mentions about Book 1, where someone named Lucy had been murdered and Bezus friend Cat worked the case. I didn't read Book 1, so I don't know the backstory. I kept wondering if this was a ploy by the author to entice readers to pick up the first book.

What I got was a great book that kept me awake and spellbound for its entirety.

The men were so well drawn and individualistic that it was easy to see why the heroine had difficulty picking just one!  I found the heroine to be pretty brave considering all that she was going through. The whole novel moved on at a good clip and I didn't find myself skimming through any of it.

The only thing that I had issues with was some of the wording in the love (read sex!) scenes. Some parts of those struck me as too flowery, almost like an old-fashioned bodice ripper. You know, the kind with Fabio on the cover.  For example the use of the word ""loins"". It pulls me out of the story every time and cracks me up with visions of a side of beef!

When they were only children, Albert pushed Juliet out of a tree which left her with an improperly healed broken leg and a limp.
A so-called friend of her brother's Lord Williams has been hanging around with a proposal for Juliet. A proposal that is less than flattering. He wants Juliet

Juliet takes matters into her hands and flees her home with a far-fetched plan in mind. She will track down the gentleman that now owns her home and plead for it back.
Jonathan Tidemore, Earl of Sinclair didn't expect to have to rescue a young lady from a drunken lord upon exiting his club. He also did not expect the woman to jump into his carriage pleading that she needed his help. He has a few thoughts in mind for the young lady. He is called Sin for reason. When the lady tells her tale of the bet and her lost home, there is not much to say, except for no.
But he is willing to make a deal. He proposes that Juliet accepts employment as governess to his 3 younger sisters.

Arthur Byrne is a college professor with tenure and a penchant for scotch and female teaching assistants and a talent for avoiding technology.  The Luddite professor has become a little bit of an embarrassment for the small college, looking to improve and grow, but they can't do much about a tenured professor.

Byrne is assigned to teach a class on Social Media - a tough course for a Luddite who doesn't even like to read emails.  But Byrne manages to pull himself together enough to take on the challenge, and with the help of his TA's, he even manages to make the class interesting - to the point of it becoming a much talked-about class. And so the school officials look for another way to remove this blight on the university, hoping to catch him in the act of cavorting with an undergrad.

Will Arthur grow up and become the professor everyone wants to learn from, or will the university catch him with his pants down and finally be able to rid themselves of him?

The book started out quite interestingly and the story held me at the start, but as it went along it grew a little more implausible and the character of Arthur Byrne grew more and more annoying. The character of Byrne came across not as a character with witty, snappy comebacks, but as an extension of the author who was trying to show off how clever he could be.  Perhaps this isn't the case, but the snappy comebacks never rang true and his patter, while it might have been fun if he were among friends, really made him out to be a jerk.  The description and some of the reviews refer to him as 'snarky' but snarky, as a constant, is straining.

As Byrne got more and more in interested in the topic he was teaching, he became likable. We could see the professor that he could be - someone actually interested in seeing students learning something. But as the students began to take an interest in what he was teaching, his popularity seemed to go to his head and he strutted around, cocky and untouchable.  Even a lawsuit by the university doesn't faze him and he walks around as though he's above it all.

As the book ends, our protagonist's misogynistic and hedonistic ways are confirmed and we can't help but wonder if he learned anything valuable at all.  We certainly didn't.

Looking for a good book? <em>Underwood, Scotch, and Wry</em> by Brian D. Meeks is a tribute to tenured college professors who play with co-eds and avoid any actual educating, but it is not a recommended read.

4654,2,A39NBTPEBLA273,B00MU30LA4,"Arthur is a snarky, underachieving, alcoholic, former writer with writers block who now reluctantly teaches at a university. Arthur has little regard for rules. The Dean decides that she wants to get rid of Arthur due to Arthurs dalliance with Arthurs TAs and Arthurs poor attitude towards teaching. How dare she. And now you may have noticed that I have neglected to use the pronoun he as happens too often in this book. The banter is clever, and this is the sort of book Id like about a witty, boozy, rebel who is too weak to resist his vices. In an attempt to find a viable reason to dismiss him, the Dean assigns Arthur to teach a class about social media of which he knows nothing. At some point, a misguided former TA accuses him of sexual harassment, and Arthur finds nothing wrong with getting drunk at a local bar with his students. All this could be amusing and at times was until in the last third of the book the feminists are portrayed as vengeful, puritanical enemies. Where did that bit of misogyny come from? All the female characters are uptight and nasty except for the ones who sleep with him or his friends.

This had the same snarky dialogue but the author lost control of the storyline in the details. SPOILERS; One, a lawyer from California cannot practice in another state unless he is licensed in that state. They can receive a special dispensation and be admitted to the bar for one particular issue if it is relevant. Otherwise they have to go through another lawyer that is licensed in the state they want to practice in. (not so much a spoiler but this one will be)...stop now if you don't want to know...There are statutory laws in place to prevent abuse of power by an attorney or a judge. Bar complaints are taken VERY seriously and no sitting judge wants to deal with that as it can threaten their license to practice and their judgeship. That being said, maybe the custody issue would have happened up until the 1980's but no more. They would have had to go through psychological evaluations, the child would have had a court appointed attorney and best interest of the child is ALWAYS the standard, I don't care what state you live in. Anyone in a custody dispute also knows that the more you can prove the other unfit the better so he should have called the police before he left his house and told them what the situation was. So, while I get that this is fiction, it still needs to be plausible and this just isn't, kind of a disappointment after the first one.

I absolutely love how the main character Lawrie is introduced, lol, she was totally weird and creepy but it was appropriate because she had been conducting experiments on herself. Sorry but the way she did the experiments induced my gag factor.

Reade as a character is funny and considerate. I also enjoy his quarrel with Lawrie as he got his arse handed to him, take that Vampire! I like the romance angle between him and Lawrie. It was fast but the author tried to make it plausible with the backstory introduction. Garrison, I loved his character. Hilarious! He is not really a sidekick but he was funny and a great addition to the story.

4659,5,A39N9SDRMYVJ0F,B00MV3AWTS,"I found this book to be very helpful. Unfortunately, my marriage DOES need help, and I never thought I'd see the day that I would be looking for a read like this. My husband and I had almost seven years of pure bliss. We met in our middle thirties, both jaded due to catastrophic past relationships and basically had both just given up on finding a mate for life. I had come out of an abusive three year relationship that I barely made out of alive. Literally. The guy beat me senseless regulatory, threatened to kill my family, and almost shot my dog right in front of me. He was mixed up in drugs and hardcore thugs, and had even done time for shooting a cop! Of course I didn't know that when we met, he was Prince charming and treated me like a queen for the first year before I found out what he really was, and his true colors came out. Turns out his father was abusive to his mother, as well, and even a real live pimp! Never would have gotten with him if i knew all of that, of course. I always said that I would never be one of those women who stuck around with a man who beat them, but now I get it. You're terrified to leave and put up with it, and get to a point where you just can't leave. Luckily I was able to escape, and spent several months in hiding looking over my shoulder and paranoid. Had to go into therapy, get on meds, etc. When I finally felt I was in a place...geographically and mentally..where I could go back in public I took a job I almost rejected, and met my husband the first day at work. We clicked immediately. Neither of us believed in k love at first sight or soul mates, but that's exactly what happened. We knew right away we were meant to be together forever. After two years of dating and over four more married, I was in a serious accident that left me unable to work, much less walk. I was the bread winner, managing a health club, working out over an hour and a half a day, and making a very comfortable life for us. Life threw us a huge curveball; I was goal for months and then gradually moved up to a walker,then cane, then finally able to walk, which was a miracle. For a year and a half I was in excruciating pain and I'm a tough chick. He had to support us on a cook 's pay, which resulted in us losing EVERYTHING. Our car, home, all of our belongings(we were shocked to receive literally everything on our wedding registry and had lots of nice furniture, electronics, clothes, artwork, you name it), even all of our wedding pictures AND our dog, which broke our hearts. We both went into a very dark place, beyond depressed, and ended up moving in with his folks. I got along with them great before, but being dependent on them was a whole other story. It was hell! He became detached, escaped everything by sleeping all day, I mean like straight through the day into the night. I got up every morning, looking for a job, still limping and in a lot of pain, researching places to live, made a new resume..hadn't done THAT in YEARS. And his parents, who started out so supportive and welcoming, complained every time we had to get to work, made us pay for our food, coffee, even toilet paper, AND had to pay coworkers to get us to and from work. Keep in mind, we both took the first jobs we could find in a really small town, and didn't know anyone out there. Different world than being in the middle of Atlanta. Anyway, we didn't communicate anymore; he slept until it was time to go to work, and when he was awake he isolated himself. His mother babies him, blamed me for not being there for him, and I felt so alone and helpless. I really did try to talk to him and would tell him I'm proud of him..even though he wasn't doing anything except going to a job his mother got for him and I'm busting my tail at a job on my feet all day, coming back to their house limping and in obvious pain, and spending all day on my computer trying to find something better for both of us and actually making an effort to get back on our feet. I literally still shouldn't have been on mine. It got to a point where I just couldn't take it anymore, and moved in with my folks, over ninety miles away. Like a spa in Fiji after that hellish situation. They make sure I get to all three(!) of my jobs and are SOO supportive. I can actually SAVE my money to reach my goals,i.e., car, residence, etc. I spent the first few weeks just crying and withdrawn, but they found me a doctor and therapist, and I'm getting back to myself. He makes these promises to get help for himself, get better job..his dad bought him a car..and doesn't follow through on anything. I love him, but it shocks me that I can go for days not even thinking about him, when I used to be so isolated after my accident I LIVED for his calls. I'm now devouring every book I can find about relationship help and coming to terms that I might actually lose what I thought was the love of my life, and by my choice. This book is helping me with that, as well as helping myself, which I haven't worked on in a long time. It feels good to just focus on me for now. I wish he would do the same, and get help. His dad is EXTREMELY bipolar, but won't take meds bc he's been""saved""-fire and brimstone religious fanatic, whole other story, and I think he is as well.

I found a number of themes in this book: What it means to be an ""unworkable"" (and why did the townsfolk cast them off when they seemed to function just fine?), explaining social norms, developing friendships and love, interpreting religion, dealing with pain on a daily basis, and (most importantly for me) dealing with impending death.  How people react in that situation always fascinates me and makes me wonder how I would react.  Would I be whiny and beg, like the woman in The Lottery by Shirley Jackson?  If I was aboard the Titanic, would I pick up my violin and start playing again or push people behind me so I would have a better chance at getting on the lifeboat?  If I was in the underground bunker in The Tithe, which of the characters would I be like?  I'd like to think I'd be like Josh, because she says out loud stuff I could imagine me thinking and has tons of questions about everything.

I really like that the author wrote this from the perspective of someone who is in pain all the time.  I'm in pain quite a bit and have seen how my daily activities have declined, and I'm sometimes despondent over it.  I've been getting better about it, and I think this book will help me continue to (mentally) heal.

I usually don't discuss what I read with my husband unless a book is really good, really bad, or otherwise notable.  We have had several discussions about The Tithe, and I like sharing this with him.

I have bought all his novels since the first Coil novel was released in 2011 and have followed his newsletters since as well. All this has done is continually whet my appetite to read these, but having authors continually request me to review their work has meant that I have been unable to start until now. I decided that between Christmas and the New Year I would read a novel of my choosing, so hence this opportunity to read Dark Edge.

I must say that waiting this long has been very much worth it! Christian special ops and Christian military are genres that I love to review (amongst others) and now this series is a worthy addition.  The other factor that encourages me to say this is that Telbat's motive for creating this series is the persecution against Christians in countries where its political environment is not Christ friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed this in another series by author Martin Roth in his Brother Half Angel Thriller series, where the

"".......focus (is) on the persecuted church. They feature Brother Half Angel, an abrasive former military man who heads a clandestine new military order that is dedicated to fighting for the rights of persecuted Christians around the world.""

I love the similarity between what I have discovered in both these series and the different bases of operation; Roth's special ops team being out of a major Korean church while Telbat's out of a specially created special ops trained Christian organisation for this purpose (COIL).

I am really looking forward to reading the rest of this COIL series. Dark Edge has set the stage really well. I am impressed with Telbat's story telling and his knowledge of how CIA operatives work. It is obvious that he has researched this and done it well. His translation of this knowledge to how Dowler operates against this organisation that has turned against him sets the pace for one intriguing read and definitely draws you in. There is a touch of Jason Bourne (from Robert Ludlum's novels and film series of the same name) in Corban Dowler and the situation he finds himself in. Not sure if that is intentional or not, does not matter, it makes for one absorbing action and suspenseful account and I guess sets more of the flavour for the rest of the series.

I really appreciated the spiritual aspects of this novella. It is great to see a Christian author show no fear in presenting what the power of the Gospel is and the redemptive power it contains including the spiritual change that takes place by the Spirit upon conversion and thereafter. In Dowler's case, he is changed from a ruthless killer to one whom by the Spirit of God now residing in him, values life as God does and, therefore, refuses to kill anymore and is willing to lay down his life for God and what being a believer in Him means even to be hunted and marked for death. However, God then turns this death sentence around and uses Dowler as a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17) and past operative knowledge and experience to rescue Christians persecuted by oppressive governments and organisations.

I classify this type of account as Redemptive fiction where, according to the creator of this fiction type, David Bergsland, this is where,

""These books offer standard rebirth scenarios where a person accepts the Savior as their Lord. They give their life to serve Him and their lives are transformedsometimes almost violently, often slowly and gently. They show a realistic look of the daily walk of faith for a believer. A clear Messiah is revealed who died for our sins. Through repentance and baptism, a person is forgiven and cleansed, beginning a new life in the Kingdom of God.
The truly excellent books on this level share these truths easily, without pretension, in common human relationships. They recognize that most people do not carry on conversations by quoting scriptures at each other. They cover the arguments pro and con. They leave it to the person to decide, recognizing that you cannot talk anyone into salvation. Only the Holy Spirit can do that. The only source of guidance is the scripture, with occasional visits from angels and the like. God speaks through the Bible or other believers primarily.""

I am pleased to see that there are elements of this description in Dark Edge. Based on this, I can look forward to more of the same in the rest of this series. As I said in my reviews of the Brother Half Angel Thriller series, I pray that this series can do a number of things; alert non-believers to the hope and life that exists in a relationship with Jesus, encourage a greater understanding of the plight of persecuted Christians in the believer and non-believer alike and encourage more Christians to pray for these Christians and even to be empower to follow God's call to do whatever He wills for them to do for these persecuted.

I very much look forward to the rest of this series, having my spirit edified, my relationship with God challenged and being educated in the plight of persecuted Christians.

I applaud Telbat (and Roth) for creating this redemptive fiction that not only entertains but does more as just mentioned and this is what Christian fiction should.

4673,3,AUF0OPKICU6D4,B00MW3FFWG,"I really quite enjoyed this, though I'm annoyed at it (the series that should be the book, IMO) being broken into so many small pieces and ending on a cliffhanger. Why do authors insist on breaking books into serials? I hate this with a burning passion.

Outside of that issue, I enjoyed the authors voice. I liked Aubrey and Riven as characters. I liked the plotline. I liked that the alpha/beta/omega universe is explained, or at least addressed. So often it's just presented and not explored and I'm left wondering why pairing have to work the way they do. I also liked that alpha (as well as betas and omegas) could be both male and female.

There was a lot to enjoy here. Granted, the editing is a disaster and, again, it's pointlessly incomplete. At just over 100 page, it could easily have been expanded into a COMPLETE work. But I'd read the next installment if it crossed my path.",ok,4,6/5/2016

4687,4,A23GRXCXQU3SM8,B00MWMQYHC,"My Review:
I have debated and debated how to rate this book...anywhere from an A rating down to a B...which has A- and B+ in between (so that's more of a spread than it sounds like). The tough thing is...I loved reading the book. The experience itself was really good. I liked the book.

What I didn't like were these two characters and what they stand for. They are NOT nice guys. Both Dima and X are mob bosses, fighting for territory in NYC. They are brutal, vicious, and their lives are filled with drugs, gun-running, and prostitution...and they're okay with that. Even with the fact that people are dying because of them. See, not nice guys. But what Avril Ashton does with these two men is brilliant because she made them empathetic. I wanted them to find their happily ever after, whether they honestly deserved it or not. There is NO character growth arc in this book. They are mean mothers at the beginning and they stay that way until the end. And I mean that seriously. These guys are NOT guys you ever want to have a run in with, because they will kill you without a second thought. Heck, they love one another and that still doesn't keep them from physically, awfully hurting one another.

But even in the gritty, dark underworld of this book, I found moments of redeeming qualities between these two. Their love is so incredibly unlikely. It made me root for them more. These are not guys who easily have/develop emotions, so when they do, that vulnerability is attractive AND that's what drew me to the characters and this story.

It's a haunting story, and even though I had my issues with the bones of the set-up, I'll admit I went and one-clicked the next three in the series. Maybe this series will be my dirty little secret (which I'm sharing with all of you)...I don't want to like the characters and what they stand for, but I just can't help myself.",A- rating,2,1/2/2016

4695,3,A1RLYCQVO9OJ0K,B00MXIIQLW,"I found the blurb of this book quite promising and I let myself be seduced by the many five star reviews on Goodreads. Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, this book did not live up to its promises. I actually contemplated to give it a two star rating on Goodreads but it is too well written for that.

The short of it is that Tabitha gets stung by an alien spider at the eve of an invasion of Earth. Once she wakes up she has mutated, and continues to mutate. Of course when she wakes up it is in a post apocalyptic world where aliens roam the lands.

It sounded quite good and the books poster picture seems to portray Tabitha as a bit of a [censored]. Unfortunately she is nothing of the kind. At the beginning of the book Tabitha starts off her human life as a bit of a looser. Okay, she is about to mutate after all so I thought lets see what happens

Unfortunately Tabitha continues to be a bit of a looser. She rarely does anything herself except reacting to whatever gets thrown in her way. The plot progresses quite slowly. There are lot of detailed descriptions of the environment as well as Tabithas thoughts which would have been okay if the plot would actually have moved on a bit but it does not. Apart from being quite slow it actually becomes a bit repetitive. Tabitha experiences one bad encounter after another but they are all somewhat similar and, quite frankly, it got a bit boring after a while.

I would have expected Tabitha to evolve during her voyage and she does indeed develop a few new abilities but she never wakes up from he sleepy walk through the countryside. She never grows up and takes command. She is mostly hiding in her own miserable wallowing and the thought of actually doing something with her abilities never seems to occur to her except in senseless fits of emotional outbursts.

Another gripe I have with this book is that almost everyone she encounters are [censored] in various degrees. I mean come on, they are really stupid, short sighted [censored]! It is like a mash-up of X-Files, The Walking Dead and I do not know what. It does not matter if it is aliens or humans or other hybrids. They are simply [censored] with a few exceptions.

As a result the book felt way too long, quite boring at times as well as rather depressing. It was far from the strong mutant woman story that I hoped it would be. The book is quite well written but the story is notwell, not so good as far as I am concerned.

I liked the idea and story line, but the execution was terrible.  I'm not sure how old the heroine is supposed to be but her actions kept making me cringe as she put herself into embarrassing and juvenile situations.  She's also manipulative and deceitful.  A lot of the supporting characters are also foolish, such as one villain who literally says, ""I'll get you for this.  You'll be sorry.""  Trite much?

The writing is awful, no depth and very superficial.  About 1/3 into the book the hero and heroine are sexing it up in a situation that just felt forced; based on their previous encounters, it wasn't quite believable.  And then afterwards, they go back to antagonism as if nothing happened, and then suddenly after another 1/3 of text they love each other.

I honestly only stayed until the end to pass the time & find out how it ends.

 The heroine wasn't likable to my way of thinking. She was TOO stereotypically ""21st century woman."" Some of the interactions had me rolling my eyes and others were just downright boring.

I felt the plot was too glossed over in many aspects. This book takes place over a 6 month period of time, but much of it is showing versus telling.

There wasn't a real sense of 'feeling' between the 2 main characters and I certainly didn't feel anything for either of them.

I mostly plodded through to the end to see how the author wrapped it all up...and it was basically lackluster as I expected. (**SPOILER ALERT** It would have been far better to have Gina actually go back to her own time & have Drake pine for her...and Gina pine for him.

Gina Charles has just broken her impending wedding with her cheating-scum, now ""ex"" fiance' and holes up at an Inn to lick her wounds...where she meets Drake Manton, a 130 y/o ghost.

Drake Manton is a ghost confined to the Hope Springs ""area"" (author is not specific of his boundaries).  And for the first time in his limbo/death experience, he encounters Gina Charles, the first person to be able to not only see him, but can speak to him as well.  Drake decides she is the key to escape this limbo existence.

This is a light and entertaining story.  It's a fun, mysteriously suspenseful, romance of a young woman (age please??), who comes to the aid of a ghost and in doing so, accidentally falls 130 years into the past.  There, in the year 1885, she tries to discover how Drake Manton dies before it can happen.  She intends to save his life in order to gain a way to get back home.  The many ways she tries to save his life are humorous, but also puts her at risk as appearing to be a first class nut.  And because she's now living in an era where it is common practice for women to be committed for the least provocation to an asylum for the insane, she must tread carefully.  But I liked this story...didn't love it.  It was easy to put down.  I never got a solid grasp of the characters because their personal physical descriptions are so weak.  And I'm the type of person who needs a solid character description to connect.  The character's personality traits are described well, but what do they look like (other than hair/eye color, etc.)  Still, I liked how Gina unintentionally begins to break down Drake's conservative, reserved mannerisms.  Her teasing and openly direct approach makes him drop his guard and she begins to intrigue him.  He begins to take notice of her.  And because she doesn't follow the protocol of social status, she constantly makes him stop and smile (which is a rarity for him)...and wonder.  He begins to find her enthusiasm refreshing, different and exciting.  Even though this book was okay, it's not anything that would make me want to pursue any more by this author.

However, I A) didn't like the language that popped up (mild but I just personally don't like it in my books) and B) I thought the romance was on the lustful side of things, especially for two people that seemed to have a very strong faith.

4733,4,ARACFU5SUPKC2,B00N0MYHC2,"Radio Silence is jam packed with things that I love! It's got an interracial romance! It's got friendship! It's got enemies to lovers! And it's got my favorite Romance trope: stranded together! Although, Arden and Gabriel aren't just stranded together. They're trying to survive whatever the heck is happening outside which forced them together. Arden and her best friend, John, left their apartment to head to the safety of his family's cabin. Of course, they hit trouble, John's brother thankfully rescues them, but that's not the end of their problems.

I really enjoyed Radio Silence. Arden is so feisty! I was annoyed with her at one point, but so was Gabriel. She made a really stupid decision, which is why when the book opens, she and John are on death's door. But she quickly grew on me, as did all of the other characters. I loved watching this little family unit knit together. It had been just Arden and John for weeks, but now they're with his older brother and younger sister, and everyone just comes together and does whatever it takes to make sure they all make it through this.

At first I was a little bummed that we get no details about what's happening in Radio Silence, but then I started to really like that we don't. It's much more realistic that way. How would Arden know anything when the power is out so there's no internet access, news, or radio? She wouldn't! This makes the tension that much higher, because everyone is just so high strung worrying about what the heck happened!

The romance was also really good. Gabriel is understandably annoyed and upset with Arden for putting his brother in that precarious situation. However, he is a doctor and sees that she's hurt and tends to her. That scene! We don't know what he's thinking, since this is all from Arden's POV, but let's just say she's having less than patiently feelings toward her caregiver. And they argue like crazy! Which of course leads to kissing and more as they're forced into each other's presence for weeks on end.

There is a slight mystery plot, which I wasn't quite that into. John and Gabriel's parents went missing while John and Arden were on their way. Obviously, Gabriel didn't know they were coming, so he never went to look for their parents because he couldn't leave their sister home alone in this chaos. Having someone there, means he can finally go look for them. It's not a bad plot, but it did leave me with unanswered questions at the end.

Shifting, shifters, how the rules and traditions of the Natural wolf pack are followed and intensified by the shifter wolves. This book is wonderfully written with obvious love for all of the human and shifter characters. We are introduced first to our Heroine, Kia, and second to her future Hero, who wastes no time living up to his title by saving her from 3 evil wolf shifters. Although he is able to incapacitate  all 3 of them with no problem, we will learn that she is a very strong character in her own right, an Alpha Female Wolf to match his Alpha Male Wolf. She was raised by a Human single mother, her shifter half comes from the father she never knew. Not even her Mother knows about the shifter side of her, and she thinks she must hide her other half even from her best friend.

Mia is a college student who is hiding the fact that she is a wolf shifter as well - she knows almost nothing about the shifter world when their paths cross and he ends up saving her from ""dark"" wolves.
The story that follows requires you to suspend reality a little bit, but is entertaining and sexy.

Maybe it's age, or long-time exposure to erotica, but sex scenes don't do it for me. I guess I'm jaded, but they just don't make my lady parts tingle anymore. Perhaps a younger reader would find more enjoyment.

That being said, the non-sexy parts of the story were pretty good. College girl Mia Fiore is quitting her job at a lousy bar, when she is attacked by three wolves outside. Rescued by a handsome, large wolf, she is saved and escorted safely home. When she reports next day for her internship at a dot-com, guess who her boss is? If you said the sexy handsome wolf who saved her, you'd be right. He wants her, but has a deep dark secret that keeps him from committing.

>I am an independent reviewer. This book is the first in the Shifters in Seattle series and ends in an HEA.  Lucas is a shifter at a high profile tech company. He is heartbroken after losing his mate to a rival shifter clan. He hires Mia, not knowing she isn't human. They are immediately attracted to each other. The attraction is acted upon immediately, which seemed kind of creepy. Mia has always hidden what she is, afraid. Lucas is patient, teaching her to shift and to embrace her wolf side.

>There is a lot of damsel in distress action in this story. Lucas saves Mia multiple times. The action and insight into how a wolf shifter must submit to their alpha is eye opening. The suspense as to who will claim Mia is palpable. The men surrounding Lucas all have interesting personalities. Hopefully, the next books in the series will star some of these shifters.

4740,3,A19MXYAHMAC99A,B00N1BXDMW,"Winter Wolf is the second book in this series but I read it as a standalone.  It has a lot going for it - Struggling heroine trying to make her mark in the acting world, one that speaks like gravel, scarred body, no family to speak of. .. . Just an agent that gets her gigs, an apartment, and this ability to manipulate electricity.  This is Nicole and her life, her family and commitments.  She balances a fine line between safety and death.

The world is interesting and the characters are deep.  I enjoyed the suspense and intrigue.  Poor Nicole had so much on her plate.  It wasn't until the ending and things didn't unfold that I got frustrated and the amount of unanswered questions.

I would like to know why a husband would stay out of his wife's life after a horrific accident.  He may have paid the bills but wasn't there in person to see her through her recovery.  I assume he was protecting her, but to keep apart for over six years?  I have a hard time believing an alpha could lead his pack without his mate by his side - His dominate wolf would drive him nuts.  Even if she's 17, was it because she was too young?  Family pressure?  Doctors orders?  WHY would any loving mate do this?  Guilt?  Did he have a hand in it?  Well. . . . We're left guessing.

So a 'normal' is human, someone without powers.  But she does have powers and is suddenly stuffed with a wolf.  Is Nicole now wolf?  What about Nicole's sister, was her wolf stripped from her?  The whole transfer situation and results were glossed over.  Was the plague delayed as  Amber and Nicole talked about or was there a cure?  And what about that artic blast only hitting the west coast?  What about wolves around the globe?  Well. . . We're left guessing.

I'd almost say this one ends on a cliffhanger but instead it gave you some meat to chew.  While this story had a lot of things going for it, the amount of unfulfilled plot twists left me raw.  Usually an author has teasers like this to keep the fans eagerly awaiting the next book.  I can see that but here I am with the 3rd book available.  It looks like a new cast of characters and I wonder if these questions here will be answered.

4741,3,A1GE2GDCXBHNAK,B00N1DVE8U,"Wow. This book is hot. From start to finish, Uncivilized is filled with dirty talk and uninhibited sex.

Anthropologist Dr. Moira Reed is sent on a mission to bring back Zacharias Easton home from the Amazon, and help him transition back into the modern world. She needs to do her best with this mission, because not only will Randall Cannon, Zachs godfather and the man who funded the whole mission, give her a generous grant, she will also be able to publish her work with the man who lived in the Amazon with a tribe for eighteen years.

Zacharias never wanted to leave his tribe. Its been his home for eighteen years, and hes happy there. But some American guy who claims to be his godfather wants him back, and he has no choice but to go with the gorgeous redhead. At first, he fought Moiras efforts and made it difficult for her, but when Moira, who is three years older, offered to teach him everything in the modern world, he has something in mind he wants to learn. And he has something he wants to teach Moira. That no matter what she does, he is and always will be uncivilized.

Believe it or not, Tarzan was my favorite Disney movie. I have a lot of fond memories of it as a kid, and I jumped at the chance to buy this book when it was on sale a while back.

As hot as steamy as the sex was, I wanted more. I wanted to see what Zachs eighteen years with the tribe was like. I wanted more from the characters. I never get to know much about them, other than their insatiable sex drives, and bits that don't get sore from too much sex. Seriously. These two were getting it on day in and day out! I wanted more story. Uncivilized is basically a PWP (Plot? What Plot?) book.

Zach has no intention of staying in the US, and he resented Moira for taking him away from the place he called home for eighteen years. He basically made it hard for Moira when they flew to the US, and he was barely civil to her until when they started sleeping together. The lust was obvious, but I didn't see what they could be beyond their sleeping arrangements.

His transitioning into the modern world felt too effortless. Eighteen years away from the US, and when he arrives, its as if he never left. I know Father Gaul, a missionary priest, visited Zachs tribe and gave him reading materials and spoke to him in English, but I don't know.

I didn't know what to think of Moira, too. Shes smart, yes. Kind. Has gorgeous red hair. But thats pretty much it.

Uncivilized, a quick and steamy tale told in alternating POVs, is filled with hot and incredibly-written sex. So thats a plus, I guess. Haha. Im definitely not complaining about that.

I would have enjoyed it more if the characters were given more substantial growth, and the story more, well story. Surprisingly, I still liked this book. It just goes to show how dirty my mind really is. LOL.

While realizing that I'm in the minority, this second book just rehashed virtually the same thing over and over and the plot didn't seem to go anywhere.  As much as I really wanted to like it, I won't be bothering with the later installments.

And I have to add in one pet peeve of mine.  While I'm fully aware that British authors use U.K. English - and that's fine; when someone is going to set their entire story primarily in the United States, make U.S. military such a primary part of the (plodding) plot, have the action move from Colorado to the West coast and back, etc.  Why not at least make the effort to ""Americanize"" the language usage?  If that's too difficult, then set the blasted thing in the U.K to begin with!  On this subject, I reached the point where I was saying to myself that ""if I see one more time the words, ""it was so and so '""FOOT' high, I will scream!""  It's not hard to figure out how to use the correct plural form of a word; and making the same mistake over and over just reeks of an unpolished effort.

I read it again because I bought the four books of the series and wanted to refresh myself of the characters.  You see I haven't read the other three yet.

I loved this book just as much if not more than the first time I read it!  The unconditional love shown in this story was absolutely amazing.  I have been in love with my husband since 1967, unfortunately we were broken up by his mother, we each married others on the rebound, neither lasted, unbeknownst to us we each got divorced in 1974, I married in 1968 he in 1970.

He contacted me in 1975 in January, May 1975 we were married never stopped loving each other.  I honestly don't think I could marry again if he died.  Love grows stronger every day for us.

Reading this book helped me to be even more grateful for the unconditional love we have for each other.  We have been very blessed.

I bought Marc's book a week ago and started reading the first few chapters and implementing some of his suggestions. I decided to tackle some priorities immediately. As a result, a few remarkable changes have already taken place in my life in a matter of a couple of days. I needed to complete my registration for accreditation, career-wise, which I had wrestled with for two years, not having any idea how to proceed. So, just a chapter or two into this book, on Tuesday I decided to tackle it. I made some phone calls, thankfully this time, got some great assistance, which I had desperately needed, sent my submission in and now I am told that all is in order and the registration of my qualifications will go through in a few weeks. I can't believe it, after such a terrific struggle!
In addition I needed to tackle a pressing Committee issue of great importance, strongly, and I did. I have no regrets because I know I did the right thing. So whatever happens, I can live with it.
What amazed me is Marc's online support. He freely communicates with me when I write, and follows up if a problem is experienced, such as with logging in, since I had made a small mistake which was blocking me.
For anyone feeling overwhelmed with issues you are facing in various situations, trying to decide how to proceed, it really helps to have an opinion from an objective motivator, which Marc is, since he helps give supportive perspective.","Marc really wants to motive his readers to achieve success, confidence and a feeling of self-worth.

Zick before, I knew going in, even in the midst of a romance, this author would, along with her authentic and touching characters and a totally engrossing plot, present some kind of deeper theme that most romance authors wouldnt touch with a ten foot pole. Turns out in her BEHIND THE ALTAR, she accomplishes those three things in spades.

Of course there is Dean, a true stud-muffin male protagonist, who instantly falls for Leah, a strong, beautiful, caring female protagonist. In romance, that may be a given, but here its done extremely well. The author also tackles a couple of themes that are doozies: First off, her depiction of the homeless issue lets us in on the daily ins-and-outs of everyone involvedwhat these poor destitute people go through and what the organizers have to contend with, such as coping with funds being removed or their spaces suddenly unavailable.

Yet Zick doesnt stop there. She has the courage to take on another strong issue not often talked about in romancesfamilial sexual abuse.

4771,5,A1JOZFD5CCXEBF,B00N2ZX5FW,"Solving a crime during the early 1930s was much different from what happens today.  There was no DNA evidence, no easy communication to compare notes with other localities, no sophisticated equipment.  What was available was the crime scene itself, eyewitnesses, accurate or not, and detective work to determine what evidence was or was not available.
 In THE BAREFOOT STIFF, Maggie Sullivan is a short, sassy, perceptive detective whose abilities are both unrecognized and unappreciated by the police department.  She doesnt let that stop her, though a shortage of clients left her continuously looking for some to help her pay her bills.
 When a blonde approached her at a lunch counter telling her that a Gentleman wants to hire you, and offered her ten dollars, she told her that she only took jobs from people who came to her office.  She watched as the blonde walked away and realized that Ten bucks would put gas in my car for a year and then some.
 A few hours later, Maggie was beginning to regret her quick reaction.  ...a dead plant in the corner of my office and the bottle of gin in my bottom drawer both saw things my way.  What could it hurt to listen to whoever had send the blonde?
 She decided to go to the address she had seen written on the $10 bill and ended up finding a recently killed man.
 The police considered her to be a witness even though the man was already dead when she arrived at the scene.  But they missed some evidence that she noticed and she decided to investigate on her own as they tried to identify the man and figure out a motive.  One possibility that the police offered was that he was a bank robber.  Bank robberies had become a dime a dozen once the end of Prohibition left unemployed bootleggers seeking other sources of income. Maggie began to focus on the evidence that wasn't there to answer those questions.
 Having read so many full-length detective novels, it took a different mindset to read one in a short story form.  But THE BAREFOOT STIFF has all the elements of a full length novel but in a very condensed form.
 I like M. Ruth Myers writing style as well as her characters and how they handle situations.  There is not much character development but, in this short story, it wasn't expected.

I didn't realize that this was a novella (which is what I get for not paying a lot of attention). I really loved the first 3 chapters. I was expecting this novella to actually be a full blown novel, but parts of it felt very rushed (towards the end).

However, I will say that the writing style was much better than I anticipated for a free novella. I didn't expect such a short read to be written so well grammatically. I also really loved Rowan. I liked that she was out and knew what she was after. I liked Rafe and his cocky attitude.

The first of this trilogy follows four prinicipal characters at the same time, in different places, as the US is caught up in a viral out break of a killed flu (that 10 yrs before whipped out billions world wide). Simultanously the US is  invaded on each coast, Chinese backed North Koreans on the west coast and Russian as well as Germans on the east coast. Most chilling of all is the fact that these events were aided and abetted by high ranking US government officials.

The Wild Fire Saga is a trilogy so this first book ends with a cliff hanger, after 300 + pages, This was such an action paced, edge of your seat suspence. I already bought the other two books and will be jumping back into the story shortly.

I have two complaints. The first is the lack of character development of the four principals, which I think was sacrificed to story action. To bad because its the characters you identify with, the action is the forward momentium but its the characters that hold the story together and assist in the believability of the overall story. The other is that there are any number of places where entire words or parts of sentences are missing. Why, I am not sure. What I am sure of is how distracting and disruptive that was.

Only  this time, it is mutated and released as a biological weapon by a high-ranking member of the American government.  However, his actions are guided by a 3rd party who seems to be in the middle of it all and is calling in his markers from those that owe him.  America is on the brink of a civil war - two presidents are attempting to rule the country and both have  followers who are intent on killing whoever gets in their way.

America is invaded by Chinese backed North Koreans on the west coast and Germans on the east coast - both under the guise of UN troops arriving to help.  However, both groups are killing America's citizens in cold blood..  Who can save them?

Apache Dawn is non-stop action and edge of your seat suspense.  I didn't appreciate such a cliff-hanger at the end of the book and thought that after this many pages, the author would have ended it differently.  There are two other books in the series which are just as long - I've downloaded them both and will get to them soon.

My only complaint is that story has numerous places where entire words or parts of sentences are missing.  I'm not sure if this is due to a formatting issue or the fault of an editor, but it was a distraction that caused me to stop reading to analyze the sentence.

The characters are shallow and the plot is thin. The only detail provided is on gruesomeness and the worst kind of violence against women and children.

I only read these 2 books because I'd wasted the money on them and didn't have anything else to read. There is no point to reading this kind of book, all it does is make me feel like all is hopeless no matter how much you prepare.",One of the worst prepper fiction books I've ever read,3,8/12/2016

As their lives reconnect several times over the next two decades, there is love, loss, heartbreak, hard work, hope, and faith in Christ between them.

This is a religious love story. I like that, but I know some people don't. I liked both Faith and Sam. I felt like they were both very believable characters. I got mad at them both. I forgave them both. And I rooted for them both, cheering them on.

Maybe I shouldn't have read it, because as much as it was nicely done, it had the 2 worst elements that frustrate me as I lose myself in a story: it had the huge age difference, and years and years of time passing before they get together.  I just don't feel the satisfaction at the end but rather a sense of loss for all those years, which in this case mostly couldn't be helped because of the age difference. Not a good combo for me. Aside from that, it had great examples of loving family relationships and an example of commitment to do the right thing.....Except  for one night at her parents home that was totally out of character for her.

When they meet each other again, hes come from a stint in Afghanistan with the Marines, and she still feels the sting of his previous rejection, but the attraction is still there. Can they make it out of the past and discover a future?

This book had a lot of petty mistakes. Some were confusing sentences, like He was better with kids than any of his siblings, and he honestly thought that precocious, curious Faith Hayes? Was a trip. There was too much head-hopping, even within the same paragraph. I cringed at the overuse of the word butt, won was used when win was needed, and 5am for 5 a.m. (I thought it was Sam to start with.) Regardless, I loved the book until it got to about 70%. The reason for Faith feeling rejected seemed so out-of-character for her that I found it a complete turn-off. I began to dislike her in this and the arguments that follow. In fact, I found the last conflicts she and Sam have to be distasteful and unnecessary.

She weaves a story where you become completely immersed in the environment. In this case, as with all her books, the actions takes place in the Carolinas. Eden Connor includes so much vivid detail, I can imagine myself right there as the story takes place. These are not fancy love stories. They are gritty with some erotic sex scenes (this one pretty tame), one where you can't help routing for the characters. Her writing is impeccable as always and Niece and Carnie are so believably real, you want to jump right into the story and give them some good advice. She also writes some very swoon worthy men who aren't there to save the women but to be their rocks while the women save themselves. Another great read.",Another swoon worthy story,2,1/13/2017

With that said, considering I've read Ms. Connor's work previously, you should know she doesn't exactly deliver easy peasy storylines tied up in a neat bow. It's what I adore about her writing. The name threw me for a loop. TuDawgs? What the heck is TuDawgs? Well, we soon find out it's the name of a hot dog stand.

Our story follows Melody ""Niecy"" Anderson. Melody has gotten herself mixed up in some pretty shady business. She was recently investigated by the FBI for embezzling from the charity she works for. She didn't do the embezzling but the guy she was dating did. The married guy she was dating. Yes, this story is M-E-S-S-Y.

The media has painted Melody as a gold digging hobag. Did I mention her married boyfriend is the Lieutenant Governor? SUPER M-E-S-S-Y!

Since Melody can't get a gig after the fiasco despite her previous high paying position and educational background, she goes and works for her uncle at his hot dog stand which is located at the fairgrounds. While serving customers, she meets Carnie aka Brass. Carnie looks like bad news and Melody knows it, but she can't stop her attraction to him.

These two... LOL, they don't do anything half-arsed. Their first meeting is explosive. This is only the beginning folks; there's a lot more included in this story that I'm leaving out, but I was engaged the entire time. This story was a solid four-star read for me, and then Ms. Connor took it up a notch at the 80% mark and turned it into a five-star story with an unforeseeable plot twist. Good job!

They find themselves seventy miles into the Tenneessee wilds, with no food, freezing and close to death, when a teenage kid enters their crude camp.

The Kid sets about helping the 'greenhorns', providing meat and other food for the group of adults and children. He shows them how to build a shelter as well as protects them from harsh men intent on doing them harm.

The point of this story, as I see it, is twofold. First as a warning to those of us who are totally unprepared for a true emergency, to learn basic skills to become self sufficient, and secondly, to live the Golden Rule. To help others as we would want to be helped.

There are elements of this story which many will not want to face, but really need to think about. How far will you be willing to go to protect yourself and your loved ones?

4813,5,A2LEMVH8KA7DX6,B00N58S0ZG,"Kudos to author Eliza Green for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thats a compliment. Dystopia is an over-populated genre, so I was delighted to discover an author who had a genuinely original idea and who was able to stay one step ahead all the way through the series. Not once did I find myself guessing correctly about where she was going with the story. There and more twists and turns than a roller coaster ahead, so buckle up.

Although Crimson Dawn is part of a trilogy, it stands on its own. The author is kind enough to backtrack, for those who have not read books one and two, without burdening those of us who did. Nice touch.

The story takes place in the future, where (as with many dystopian tales) Earth has become less than a paradise, even for the wealthy. A new planet has been found and tamed, but with unexpected consequences. At the heart of the trilogy is, to who does Exilon belong and what does that mean for residents of Earth? The Indigenes, a resident humanoid race, would seem to have the better claim, but here come the plot twists. These people are not what they seem at first; nor, for that matter, are any of the multifaceted characters the author has so artfully developed.

What impressed me most was that the science was neat and well thought out: enough that suspension of disbelief came naturally. Also, I was left with an unsettling feeling at the end, hoping the author doesnt have the ability to see into the future.

4818,5,A21TSBBTF0DMG5,B00N5TWLH8,"Ive become a big fan of Christina Tetreault over the last few years. When I discovered the opportunity to purchase the audio version for $1.99, I immediately took advantage of it. This is Book 5 in her The Sherbrookes of Newport series, and its the best one I have read so far!

Trent Sherbrooke is the typical playboy, never having any type of relationship other than sexual with any women. While his initial plans to go along with his campaign managers suggestion to find a suitable wife, sounded like a good option to help repair his damaged image, he does not believe Addison would be the right woman. He thinks he needs a woman who is well aware that it will be strictly a business arrangement, mutually beneficial for both of them.

When a picture shows up in the tabloids, and his manager tells him she is exactly what he needs, he balks, but eventually goes along. He soon realizes that Addison is a woman of substance, and he no longer wants just a marriage of convenience. He wants the real deal.

Can what started out as a means to an end, turn into a forever kind of love, or will Addison run if she finds out how their romance originally started?

Redeeming a Billionaire is a fast-paced, easy reading experience. Ms. Tetreaults writing style is smooth and flowing, making this an engaging story. The plot is believable and the characters are great.

Addison is an endearing heroine, and I became fully vested in her character from the start. It was hard to trust Trent since he had such a bad reputation as a love em and leave em kind of guy, but she still manages to open her heart to him and believe he can fall in love with her.

At first, I was not sure I would like Trent. His reasoning for going along with his managers suggestion is underhanded and does not show him in a favorable light. As the romance unfolds, his quick turn around involving his feelings for Addison, went a long way in getting me to fall in love with his character. By the end of the book, I was rooting for him to win Addisons devotion.

The sensuality of Redeeming a Billionaire is a step up from what is normally there in Ms. Tetreaults books, and definitely, fit this story. The chemistry between Trent and Addison is combustible, and I thoroughly enjoyed their love affair.

I listened to the audio version performed by Piper Goodeve and really enjoyed her narrative. She reads with just the right amount of emotion and gives the characters distinct voices. I will be looking for other books narrated by Ms. Goodeve.

If you like a light-hearted love story with good depth of character and a great plot, then you will love Redeeming a Billionaire as much as I did. Although this book is part of a series, it is a stand-alone. Happy reading!",My Musings,3,4/27/2016

Throw in a conflict between the birdman and his daughter-- over a too-quick remarriage-- and things are going to get complicated and dangerous.

My only complaint is that it's hard to keep track of some of the characters without a program. There is a subtle art of reminding the reader of who's who when a character makes a repeat appearance-- or becomes the topic later of conversation. When it's done well, we make the connections and we don't notice; when it isn't, we get lost.  Thus, a four star rating on a five star yarn.

4827,4,A2UU56MYHS809T,B00N6UOGVK,"As its name suggests Orientation is just that. This is the first of 5 books in the Commorancy series by Al. K. Line which presents the world in the grips of a disease called The Lethargy, where those afflicted just give up and waste away until they finally pass on, trapped in a waking coma of sorts.

Not everyone succumbs the Lethargy however those who remain unscathed are deemed Whole and those who succeed in harnessing an inner potential to become more than the Whole are termed Awoken.  Once Awoken, you can stop the aging process, see into the Noise (where all things are), enter and manipulate the minds of other persons and animals and many other things.

Orientation centers around Marcus, the Awoken founder, creator and Leader of the Commorancy, a sanctuary hoping to preserve humanity currently on the brink of extinction. While the Commorancy is a vast structure consisting of many Rooms, there is only room for 7 guests at a time. Having passed a series of tests and riddles in order to obtain an invitation from Marcus himself, each Guest may remain for as sort or long a time as they require, as long as they follow the Rules that have been set forth.

The most recent guest to arrive, Letje, a 15-year-old girl with her pet tortoise in tow, seems to have her Orientation interrupted at every turn. In addition to Marcus and the Commorancy, we find out that there is another Awoken sect called The Eventuals led by Varik whose goal is the total extinction of humanity. As the attempts from the cult to infiltrate and bring down Marcus and his lifes work intensify, Marcus is forced to break one of his cardinal rules in an attempt to stop them. He must disturb his guests and organize a defense in an effort to stop this most recent and significant threat.

Having read a few other books by Al that come after this series it must be noted that the idea of the Commorancy, The Lethargy, Awoken and The Eventuals are not confined to this series alone and have also appeared in at least two others that I am aware of. That being said, it was really nice to go into the back story of the mythical Marcus and see the man behind the mask.  There is a scene in the Room for Evening Drinking that really served to get inside the man and show that for all of the amazing things he has done, he is only human even if he is hundreds of years old. The back stories of the 7 other guests, how they came to be at the Commorancy and their reaction upon being brought out of their rooms, were also enlightening.

Varik, as an antagonist and leader of the Eventuals seems to embody just exactly what can go wrong when religion is perversed to the point of blasphemy. The cult of the Eventuals, his blind following flock and lengths they will go to in an effort to bring about the extinction of what remains of humanity is chilling.

Cordell shows up in Marietta and he appears to be a city boy but looks can be deceiving.  He is also dealing with issues from his childhood.

Payton and Cordell due to circumstances and a crusty old man they end up spending lots of time together.  They are extremely attracted to each other.  The intimate scenes are closed door with great tender and passionate moments.

I read some of the novels that I grew up with and got a treat to read some that I had never heard of and they are all wonderful. If you are easily offended by old southern racial references then maybe some of his work is not for you but I felt that he did not look down on African Americans because he put the runaway slave Jim on equal footing with Tom and Huck and he wrote from his time in history and it was the norm, the way people of different races interacted at that time. Mark Twain's novels are full of humor and irony, and some very deep insight into the workings of the human spirit and mind.

(Surprisingly, he didn't mind Black people, but he was a strong believer that all Native Americans could be categorized as ignorant savages who should all be rounded up and killed.)

This is a great read for its target age. My 9 year old son will love it but even my 14 year old daughter is taken with it. The story is fresh and different; It's a dystopian novel but not at all usual. Great plot twists and diverse characters with an intriguing mystery keep the action going. The author reveals the storyline piece by piece while skillfully building the world around the characters.

My only complaint is this - the author cleverly  has the characters mix up words and ideas from history (Made Marian and Robbing the Hood) but supposedly these stories come from bits of history collected in a scrapbook by Chess's father. If they read these stories they would know that the word was ""kaleidoscope"" not ""colliding scope"".  Just a thought, but not one that's going to bother young readers.

The justice system is about the same as the American justice system including someone getting a life sentence for murder and only serving a few years. That seems so unfair!

Mounting evidence against him changed her mind, however, and eventually she was convinced he was a sociopathic type killer.  While all the evidence against him was circumstantial, he was still convicted in 2007 and given a life sentence.

Ms. Friel does an excellent job retelling the story in this book, first published in 2007.  It never bogs down, and always keeps the reader wondering what was going to be uncovered next.  It was also an interesting look at An Garda Sochna, the Irish police service, and the court system in Dublin.  For example, individuals the Garda want to question can be arrested and held for so many hours; and Joe O'Reilly was not locked up until the day a jury found him guilty. My only complaint about this captivating and sad true crime story is that it ended so abruptly, and what happened to the O'Reilly's two young sons was never disclosed. Who got custody of them?

What I adore about her style is her ability to create intense and loving characters who meet in unlikely ways, edging out the darkness in their past to have the lives they deserve.

Cheers galore for her witty dialogue, stunning alpha male hotties who climb right off the pages into your fantasies.  And, OMG, does she do justice to our emotions through anger, passion and tenderness.

I love Shane aka Stony and Dr. Annie and everything they bring to each other.  The fact that we remember him from the Alvarez Security Series is just icing on the cake.  This writer does an amazing job in weaving our favorites from one series into another and the fact that all are stand-alone novels with a HEA makes it that much better.

I do not see how the lead female could possibly be drawn to a guy like him but it is after all fiction:) This story was poorly written and dragged on way too long. The editing was bad, lots of left out words or missed words altogether. For a ""best selling"" author you would think she could afford an editor at least!

This is a lovely book.  It had a rare typo which I only mention because another reviewer brought up the subject.  In fact, the typos are rare enough that they are not distracting or irritating.  Most of the romance erotica I read have many more typos than this.
As far as the ""crude"" language, the language reflected the character who was a product of the world in which he lived.  I am retired now but I worked many years in intensive care units.  I heard language like this on occasion but when you are working in life and death (as a policemen does as well) sometimes only the most extreme language fits the most extreme situations.  When I later went into the field of computers (due to burnout) I did not hear nor feel the need to curse myself.  After all, no one's life was in danger.  The situations could be frustrating but not life threatening.  What I am saying is that unless you have experienced jobs like these, you really cannot judge.  In addition, the synopsis warns of ""crude"" language so can chose to not read the story.  I never felt the author's use of language was gratuitous. In fact, I commend the author on not using misogynistic or degrading language towards women; a practice common in the erotica genre.
I do feel the ""sunshine"" theme was a little overused.  A few times she seemed so sweet as to be a little saccharin and not real.  I also felt that the author had the character feeling a little too much guilt about her quick  involvement with Stoney.  After all, they had developed a rapport over Sarge's surgery, she was 27 years old, and single.  I like strong, sexually confident women.  I have never understood the double standard of shaming women for sex while nothing is said about the man, or worse,  the ""boys will boys"" attitude or slap on the back as a player.  With putting all the responsibility for sex on women with the old ""cow giving away the milk for free""  adage, I have always maintained that women are not cows and that it takes a bovine mentality to make such a disingenuous accusation.
As a previous health care provider, I give the author 5 stars for her social responsibility of having the Shane character use condoms.  Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are on the rise.  In the meantime, a lot of stories, movies and other art forms have the males going ""bareback"" sending the message of irresponsibility to our young.  Also, kudos to the author for having the characters discussing birth control responsibly as many novels have the characters employing withdrawal as a method of birth control.  Withdrawal is not a reliable method of birth control as many women get pregnant on pre-cum ejaculate.
I also liked that the author had Shane asking if she liked to be spanked.  What a novel concept; a respectful man COMMUNICATING to his lover about her likes and dislikes.  If only men read these kind of books!
In closing, I think my review shows the respect I have for the author's book.  She has written a steamy romance between 2 likeable characters while keeping intrigued.",One of the best books I've read on Amazon!  I look forward to the author's other writings!,2,8/14/2016

4891,2,A2WZYL0HNUR5XH,B00N9YTICU,"20% of the way in, the author gives a total spoiler in a chapter preamble.  Why should I then keep reading?  Mostly from curiosity why the author did that, and to find what the info package is (he delivers on that) and why the Enforcers are so dead set against this info package drop (total washout there, they don't know or care about it).

I agree with the comments  in Dacy's ""dark, scary..."" review, but he on balance recommended it and I do not.  Consider what you want to experience:

- 3 of 3 romantic pairs suffer one or both killed, so no consummations for anybody.  Something around 2/3 of the principle characters killed, and all but one of the 5 or 6 leads dead or permanently imprisoned (justly so).  The one remaining is neither likeable nor principled, and too easily manipulated.

- Three principle characters are all murderers, two of them in cold blood, the third in statistical calculation (87%) fight an all-against-all battle in which none of them know what the other's agenda is.  Each has a completely different reason for the struggle.

- Rehash of an old utopian fallacy (similar to Clarke's Childhood's End) drives one of the principals, and the author does a good job of presenting a balanced case of why it is really dystopian, but doesn't resolve it or suggest any resolution in the sequel.

Only one of those is positive, and only weakly so.  Thus my rating.  In addition the author engages in pages of random philosophizing, pages between fist blows or dialog statements, completely unreal (a trait some other modern authors share), which makes the novel drag and seem overly long.  The subplots are pretty much unconnected until the end, and depend too much on wild coincidence for the accidental rendevous on Trassia.  This is not only a violation of the principle of entropy, but this esoteric principle (not named as such) is a hidden subject of the book (consider the Opus Craine's comments about time, their indistinguishability, and the two degenerative diseases one physical one mental) and thus its violation is significant.  The author keeps dragging up religion, and wonders if at any moment it will transition from sci fi to fantasy or even preaching, which might explain the time-entropy-coincidence, but he never does and doesn't suggest he is going to in the sequel.

A quick glance at the sequel synopsis suggests a 2nd iteration on the themes of the first book rather than a continuation or conclusion.  If not, the author should clarify the marketing materials.","disjointed plotting, disposable characters, an old utopian-dystopian paradox",4,6/7/2016

This is not meant to detract from a great story that is part of a larger series and timeline. I like that she creates female characters as the central part of her stories.  We need more strong female characters to serve as role models for our young. This is not to overlook Laxmis understanding of literary devices, either.

Using torrents as a ""freebie"" and then justifying it by saying, ""well, don't be a cheapskate. Leave a review for the item(s),"" was appalling to me.

When twins are born conjoined, they are separated if they can be. Sometimes that takes months, in this case, one twin was minus several major organs. This is normally called a parasitic twin, and is not considered alive. The first twist in this book is that the otherwise parasitic twin, the one with out a heart and only half of a lung, is alive. He is able to sustain life with out all his parts. Thus starts the story of Alexander, and Derick Cole, and some other people. Derick Cole is a likable ""freelance"" detective. He has a past that we get to learn about, and his mission is to protect people on Alexander's list.

I really enjoyed this book. To me it was plausible enough, and barring that, this is good fiction. Things that we don't understand do happen. Alexander Black is one of them. I enjoyed this book so much that I bought the boxed set of Derick Cole novels 1-4 and put in a pre-order for the 5th book.

Lord McCaulay is your typical well-to-do playboy of Victorian London. He is quite wealthy and good-looking, which gets him everything he wants. He also believes that women are just playthings, he would never imagine settling down to be a husband to some nagging woman. His desires lead him to a gentlemans club he has heard will satisfy your every carnal wish. His first night there, he is humiliated by the woman who owns the club. Yet, he is aroused and intrigued at the same time. Intent to show her that he is in control, he goes back to the club. Once again, he is a pawn in her games. He cannot seem to get enough of this woman who goes against everything a woman should be. He is powerless to her. That may be a sign that is time for him to get far away from her. But can he?

Maud is a woman of society who is quite unhappy. Her guardian, her old-fashioned aunt, is the complete opposite of what Maud wants to be. She wants to be well-educated, she wants to learn and do as she pleases. She doesnt want to be scene and not heard. She wants the freedom of a man. As her aunt pushes more suitors on her, she is more and more against getting married and being the dutiful housewife. Can she find the pleasure she seeks?

This erotica at its best. It is hot and heavy, and you will be left breathless with flushed cheeks. But is so much more than that. There is a wonderful story behind the hot scenes too.

4943,4,A3IRDL4HSN8FCF,B00ND6R1QE,"Victorian England was a time for women to be seen and not heard. They were stifled; being denied their opinions as well as their pleasures. It was perfectly fine for men to sleep around, even expected, and that's where the Gentleman's Club came in.

Lord Henry MacCaulay is a frequent visitor to the club, and it's there that he meets Mademoiselle Noir; a ravishing beauty with a mask and a secret. He is drawn to her, and she delights in tormenting him. For, within the walls of the Gentleman's Cub, it is she who holds the power.

I want to begin this review by saying that the Gentleman's Club is definitely not for anyone under 18. It's full of extremely detailed sex, and I'm not ashamed to say that it's one of the sexiest stories I've read this year. The sex scenes compliment the plot nicely and provide periodic breaks between the narration.

The two main characters are dynamic and personable, and you can't help but wonder if the handsome Lord will ever tame his strong-willed and independent temptress. The supporting characters are also interspersed nicely and give their scenes a feeling of completeness.

I didn't really have any complaints, other than I felt the story itself was too rushed. I know there is a sequel, but I feel like the narration was hurried in order to reach the sex scenes. Personally, I would have enjoyed more of the story.

She was delighted by the news, but not so thrilled when Ford insists they get married, especially when his recent return to Whitaker Falls after eleven years away is shrouded in secrets. Ford has always wanted Grace. Even back when he was the town rebel and should have known better -- until he was blamed for the death of her brother and was shunned by the community. Now a millionaire businessman, he's back to claim what is rightfully his . . . including Grace and the baby they'd created together.

An emotional story, with really good main characters.  I liked it.

It really struck me in a certain spot in the story how uncaring most of the people in the town had been towards Ford as a young man.  He went hungry for days and no one noticed although they did pay attention to making his life a ""living hell"", in other ways.  And when he came back there were very few people willing to welcome him back or even try to see him as he was now.  It was heartwarming though that a few did.

There were some good, interesting people in the story as well.  Ellis, Grace's father was one of the ""not so nice"" people of the story.  His hatred of Ford was still alive and easy to come to the surface for ELEVEN years.  It's a wonder he didn't have another heart attack after living with that eating him alive.  I really hated how he treated his very much grown up daughter and the way he tried to manipulate her.  While I understood where it came from, I still hated it.

4951,3,A2S5EPJ451WL3I,B00NDVY95K,"WARNING: This review contains spoilers.

WARNING: This book contains extreme violence (scenes of torture)

Running on Empty is an interesting start to a series, about a rescue organization (Last Chance Rescue Elite) mixed with spycraft taking on extremely high-risk rescue missions. While the high concept was interesting, that the MMC was brainwashed into believing FMC had betrayed him, and vowed to exact revenge on her, that can't sustain the book and it was resolved easily at 25% point with MMC basically switching sides. And while the FMC and MMC had to undergo trials and tribulations to stay together and find and defeat the enemy, the idea that the bad guys basically spent a TON of money and operatives for NO appreciable gain except they get to, uh... torture two operatives was just... nonsense!

To recap... Sabrina Fox was one of the best female agents ever produced by The Company. She eventually tired of the game and was transferred to the civilian organization LCR (Last Chance Rescue) rescuing victims from the most volatile regions in the world. Her marriage to Declan Steele, her trainer, lover, and fellow Company employee, was a secret, but she was elated when he said he was contemplating retirement. Then he disappeared. Then months later she got a text to meet him in Paris... she thought she saw him, then just as she approached the cafe, it exploded. She eventually recovered physically, but she was dead inside, having locked down her emotions and continued on her missions...

But Steele was not dead. Whoever captured him tried to torture secrets out of him, and brainwashed him into believing that his wife was the traitor that set him up. Months later, he was rescued, and the only thing on his mind was revenge... how he will get his hands on her... But when he finally did get her... he couldn't quite do it. As his memories came back, he slowly realized that he had been played... and there was a mole in the company that he was trying to find... But whoever that was, he was very very close, and very very good. As they narrow in on the traitor, the traitor kidnapped Sabrina and tried to torture secrets out of her instead. Now Declan must race against time, with the rest of LCR on his side, to rescue the only woman who has his heart.

The characters are nice and detailed and mentally broken in many ways. But the main plot... doesn't make sense. Capturing Steele to get secrets out of him didn't work. So why release him as a trick? Why go after Sabrina later? It makes no sense! Who spent this much money to fake a death for nothing?  Then kidnap Sabrina and transport to a different nation, and setup fake clues, again, for no gain? What was their motive? Makes no sense except to setup for the rescue!

4956,3,A3SN8H1V126IIY,B00NE0CCD6,"UPDATE: I read the fourth book (Light the Lamp) and decided I'd had enough.

The first three books were good (barring the foul language). But the female character in book 4 is just too flighty and ditzy. All those endearing characteristics (such as forgetting to wear shoes or take precautions for her safety) would become a huge irritation once the guy is with her more than a couple months.

Also, the story-line is pretty flimsy. Really, a woman would give up the safety and security of a warm home with food to eat and instead choose to live on the streets -- and this, after only being with the guy 2 weeks? She decides after that short time that she just can't be the recipient of generosity that she cannot reciprocate? Puhleez...

 These novels are stand-alone books, which I appreciate. I also really liked the first book ""Breakaway"". The second book, On the Fly"" is really a novella -- so I felt a little gypped. By the third book I could hardly stand all the F-bombs. The first book was peppered with them, but by the 3rd, it was every other paragraph (if not every other sentence). Okay, I get it -- this is a book about the rough hockey world. But at the heart of them, they are romance novels.

4957,3,AUPJU39EJF45V,B00NECU9W0,"First of all, female readers should probably add a star to my rating. If you're a paranormal romance fan, add another. Don't think me sexist, I understand audiences and how they connect with books. By the same measure, if you consider The Once and Future King, the Harry Potter Series and Simon R. Greene's knights of the golden torc series to be equally good, add two stars to my rating.

There are plenty of those readers out there. You can see from the cover that Cloak of Shadows won a Readers' Favorite award from some organization. And the other reviews.

By the end of the book, I was on board too. However, even though I know which readers react best to Cloak of Shadows, I still felt the first installment of CK Dawn's Netherwalker series stumbled out of the gate. Dawn ties the series to Arthurian legends but the storyline would have worked equally well without the connection. In fact, nothing about the Camelot connection enhances the storyline. And there's the rub.

Lourdes and her disciple Abbey fight netherwalkers, characters who dwell in the shadows to channel human souls to their masters in another dimension. They plug into an elite worldwide network, the King's Court, evolved over the centuries from Camelot's round table. The court's head, Lord Templeton, insists that Lourdes fly to England to train Court knights in her innovative fighting techniques, most particularly the ability to summon multiple orbs used to banish netherwalkers to their home realm.

Once in England, however, the knights can't duplicate Lourdes' orb making skills. Lord Templeton's disdain over her Americanized fighting skills doesn't help. Nor does the sudden onslaught of nightmares that sap her energy day-by-day.

As you might sense from the description, nothing in this story depends on Arturian legends as a foundation. You can substitute by UNCLE, Harry Dresden's White Council or Harry Potter's Order of the Phoenix for the Court and the story works equally well. Dawns desire to construct a new world for readers makes reading the story feel like driving through five-o'clock traffic with a stop sign at every block.

I mention the Order of the Phoenix because Abbey attends S.B. Devere, a private school for King's Court trainees that sounds remarkably like Hogwartz. The main difference being the presence of ""dociles"" (read ""muggles"") to lend cover to the school. As much as you want to feel Cloak of Shadows is a fresh take on established myth, too many of the pieces feel familiar.

Nor does Dawn control the pace with which she brings readers into her new world. In the first few chapters, she hurls dozens of characters at the readerlove interests, fellow court members, cafe owners and teachersalong with their place on the organizational chart. Every time the action picks up, a new character leaps into the story, including detailed dossier, to slow it down.

Four or five chapters into the story, Lourdie and Abbey fly off to England and every  supporting characters we've had to memorize drops from the story. Completely. Dawn drops readers into a new story, a new organizational chart and the process begins again.

The good news? Once she finishes the chart, Dawn finally plunges into the real story: the romantic jousting between Lourdie and Templeton, the netherwalkers' psychic assault on Lourdie, her frustrations as she tries to train the knights. When she sees signs that the netherwalkers might be gathering at the gates to invade for the first time in centuries, no one believes her.

At long last, Cloak of Shadows gathers speed toward a quick kick finale.

Dawn welds strong girders to frame her vehicle. She makes the mistake of trying to hook up the world she intends to drag with her into the following novels like an overweight trailer. She did win a reader's favorite award with this book, so she earned a following. Had she jettisoned the world building and jumped the pond to England on page one, she would have delivered a page turner and, perhaps a book that really leaps from the crowd of her competitors.
The school would still be there, and Lourdes' favorite haunts in New York, and the kicked out guild quarters when she opens book two.

4958,5,A3SDR7ZOF8BLUJ,B00NECU9W0,"What a captivating and well-written story.

The story pulls you into the action right from the start, then slowly unfolds the history as you go. I love this approach as it captures and holds my attention far more successfully than otherwise. The author has created an interesting and robust history to support the modern day demon hunters. What I find even more interesting is that they banish the demons rather than destroy them, which is a nice change to some of the more morbid and dark stories out there.

What really stands out here are the characters. Two strong females (Lourdes and Abby) are at the center of the tale. But whether it's these two or the large supporting cast, the characters are well-developed, interesting, and just plain likeable. I love the little additions like a pink taser for the young apprentice.

4960,5,AZ8INYIW0SWLY,B00NEON2WC,"I'm going about it backwards and putting my only criticism first. There were two direct quotes from Jane Austen (with the gender swapped out) that were inserted in the prose in such a way that felt like plagiarism rather than a nod to the great author. That bothered me.

Otherwise, I loved the book. Loved it. I'm surprised to read some of the negative reviews that the characters were one-dimensional. They weren't. Nor were they clich. Sure, a scandalous woman on the fringe of society who has good character and a soft heart is not unusual (I'm thinking of Faro's Daughter), but George is a character all in his own. He brought everyone - including the widow (and the book) - to life. He also managed to buck tradition without making it unbelievable, or him unlikable.

And then there was a parallel plot of rediscovering love within the confines of marriage. Those characters were mutli-dimensional too, even if they were slightly less developed than the principal characters. The plot was steady, and yeah the brother was a bit off and not fully developed, but the overall affection I had for the characters made this a 5-star rating for me. I would read other books by this author.",Well developed,2,5/12/2016
4961,4,A31OCPZKOOTDZS,B00NEON2WC,"Let me start off by saying that although this is labeled as book number three in a series, you do not need to have read the other books in order for this one to make sense. All these novels are stand-alone, meaning there are no cliffhangers and each book has a beginning, a middle and an ending.

That being said, this was a very sweet read that was easily finished within a couple of days. There was some witty dialogue between the characters, a ""vicious"" dog carried in the Hero's pocket, and a happily-ever-after that was worth the struggles the characters had to overcome in order to get there.

On the downside, I do feel that the author missed the mark a bit with the villain of this story. There were some missed opportunities to add some real background and depth to that part of the story that I feel was overlooked.

Before I close, I feel that I should mention the fact that when I originally downloaded this book, it was one of the kindle free deals. For a FREE book, I found it to be all of the things mentioned in my review. However - I feel that its ""normal"" price of $6.99 is a bit too pricey for me with what the story held.

4962,4,A3WIMAMMYF48X,B00NEON2WC,"TO WED THE WIDOW by Megan Bryce

An intelligent Regency!

I must confess that I rarely read Regency novels. I generally find them silly and nearly always formulaic and poorly written. I've only read a few that I liked and only one that I actually remember. (if I can find the title, I really should write a review for it.)

Megan Bryce has done something that few writers seem to be able to do. She's written an intelligent Regency with well rounded characters and an interesting plot. It is also well written and properly edited. Wow!

I think most readers will fall for George Sinclair (the delightful main character) and will enjoy Elinor, (the scandalous widow) and Flora (George's sister in law). I even liked George's brother,  Sebastian (the Earl).  I didn't think he was a jerk, as other readers have written, but thought that he acted very much in character for the time and situation. I also loved the dogs and thought they added a great deal to the story. Even Elinor's servants were described in enough detail that they seemed like real people by the end of the book, and Camilla (Flora child) was essential to the story. How she interacted with George revealed a great deal about the kind of man he was. Small things like this added real depth to the story.

The book had no explicit sexual content and the language was mild and appropriate.  The inability to carry a child to term was a theme in this book. Although it was handled with delicacy and respect, those who have experienced this tragedy should not be blindsided with a situation that could trigger grief.

Odds are that I'll be reading more books by Megan Bryce. Anyone who can write this well is worth reading again.",An intelligent Regency!,7,4/28/2016
4963,5,A1EZD7IJOOAF6S,B00NER75BS,"I mistakenly read this book after reading the second one on this engrossing series. Both books can easily stand on their own as very well researched and written historical novels. The main theme of slavery in Jamaica in the 18th century is dealt with by aspects of slaves and masters including all the various opinions by all sides be they actively participants or observers. The saddest fact I come away with here is that the outward opinions and actions of the perpetrating white owners then are still harbored in 2017 by their descendants. This racial prejudice is well documented in this book...imbedded in the religious, economic and political structures of the 18th century here. The author interweaves the lives of the characters as lives are destroyed, dignity trampled, human kindness extremely rare and ignorance abounds, mostly by the whites. On top of this is the offhand and politically accepted idea that women, whether black or white, are less intelligent and not as worthy as men. My God! I would go insane living under such strictures as a white woman literally expected to do nothing but be a table centerpiece for her husband's home except as a bedmate when ""he"" feels the ""need."" As a black woman/female child I have no words to properly express my disgust and anger over any woman used as property, raped, overworked, forced to procreate, tortured and divided from my loved ones and treated as such by whites and blacks alike. This is a great book for young people, as well.... sixteen and up.  They should learn the true history of slavery and its impact on generations of ignorance as it has evolved. The one highlight, for me, was the incident with Mr Hollister and his wife's ""borrowed"".....it's hard to understand Doug's decision to allow that young woman to go to the Hollister, and actually encouraging her with his foreknowledge of life there. No excuse.....it's all on him as far as I see it. As for the relationships of Kate, she appears to be the only person who has the ability to truly see into the human heart. I would have loved to have seen her father's reaction to his first grandchild. This is a definite ""highly recommend"" read. I thoroughly ate it up!

Julia considers herself lucky to have found someone willing to wed her after being embroiled in the dreadful courtroom drama surrounding Rolands crime, in which she was tapped as the only eyewitness.

Now comfortably, if not precisely happily, married to successful, socially acceptable Charles King, she roams her idyllic estate with her sister Lennie, trying to discourage the younger girls obvious interest in a dashing sea captain, and suppress her own romantic memories of Roland. Recurring visions of Annies murder, however, give Julia the discomfiting sense that all is not as it seems.

When Lennie falls pregnant and has to leave the country in disgrace, Julia is alone with Charles, who is gradually revealed as cunning, ruthless, and utterly domineering. He claims he is the long-estranged brother of her now hung sweetheart Roland, and takes her to the de Claire estate to prove it. There, driven by her nightmares, her suspicions of his motives become so apparent that Charles has her locked in a madhouse.

Author Ledge has constructed a stirring, twisted tale in which something unexpected occurs in almost every chapter. Some readers may find that the beginning of the story moves slowly, but they will be rewarded for their patience when the suspense builds the work into a page turner.

The story opens with up-to-now vanilla Kate Lambert in search of a Dom. Shes been envious of her best friend ever since Janine spilled the beans that she and hubby Chris have a D/s relationship. The more Janine divulged and explained about the dynamic the more Kate longed to find that for herself.

""Shed seen the blissful look on Janines face when she knelt at Chriss feet. Shed daydreamed about someone making her feel that way too. To have that deep connection to and synchronicity with another person seemed almost impossible, but somewhere, deep inside herself, she thought she was capable of that.""

Kates job as a drug abuse counselor is not only stressful, its heartbreaking at times. Giving her all to a client, leading them down the road to recovery, only to see them return doesnt sit well with Kate the perfectionist. Shes become a workaholic with absolutely no social life. No matter what she does she just cant get out of her head, forget about work and the real world, and let herself enjoy life. Maybe finding a Dom she can submit to is the answer.

""The idea of someone inflicting painsmall amountswas one of her biggest fantasies. And admittedly, some of the photos shed seenwomen on leashes, kneeling at mens feet, heads bowedwere pretty damn hot. Shed like to try spanking, at least once. Maybe bondage, but she needed full control. Forget a safeword; she wanted to direct every moment. That didn't bode well for being a submissive. She knew that much.""

Ill admit, I tend to prefer the more hard core BDSM novels. This is not one of those. Nevertheless I loved this book because it is totally believable and true-to-life. Kate could be any number of women craving to experience their submissive nature. Craving to relinquish themselves and all control to a man they trust implicitly, yet at the same time fighting against it. Entering into a D/s relationship goes against everything girls are taught these days. The vanilla world looks down on women who give up their power to a man. And this is exactly what Kates inner battle is all about.

When she meets Banner Jennings at Janines Halloween/matchmaking/find Kate a Dom party, her inner sub falls to her knees. Not only is he gorgeous and commanding, hes unassuming. He also makes it clear shes not his type. Hes a Master looking for a 24/7 slave. Kate is a newbie who has no idea what she wants and Banner isn't interested in a sub. But theres something about her he cant resist, and he doesnt want to see her taken advantage of. Yeah, thats it. Against his better judgement he proposes to train her, then help her find a Dom. Mmhmm.

What I love most about this book is the amazing chemistry between these two. Its intense and delicious, and it kept me turning the pages. Watching Banner deal with Kates bratty side and snarky comments is adorable. If she were his slave hedbut shes not his and as training progresses he has a hard time remembering that. He also has a hard time remembering hes a Master who doesnt put up with that s***. Hes so smitten and attracted to Kate its driving him crazy! As far as Kates concerned Banner may be frustrating as hell but hes exactly what she wants in a Dom. Too bad he keeps insisting hes a Master and will accept nothing less than a slave. He brings out every submissive bone in her body even though she fights it. Her body says: Dominate me, please Sir! Her mind says: You want me to do what?

As Kates training progresses, so do Banners feelings for her. Convinced he cant be what she needs he reluctantly hands her over to another Dom. His best friend, Ambrose. Because hes certainly not going to let her go to some stranger. Watching her with Ambrose just about kills him, but Banner believes its for the best.

If the two of you fall in love, maybe this mess in my head will mellow out. Maybe Ill get over her if I see your collar on her neck.

But I don't get it! Why is my collar on her neck okay and yours isnt? Slave is just a word. Why don't you call it something else and keep her?

Exactly, Banner! Why do men have to be so damn stubborn? Poor Kate. I could feel her confusion and rejection even though shes attracted to Ambrose, and they have a great time together. Bottom linehes not the Master she wants. Yes, she wants Banner as her Master. As happens when people fall in love, Kate would do anything for Banner. And Banner would do anything for Kate. Thank goodness Ambrose sees through the mess these two are in.

This is not only a heart poundingly sexy story, its lots of fun, the dialogue is witty, and the writing is fantastic. I loved every minute!",Loaded With Sexual Tension and Amazing Chemistry!,3,1/9/2016

I won't be preached to by anyone while I'm reading. Maybe some reality is needed here. Who pays more in taxes? Who gives more to charities? I put myself through school twice without grants from anyone since I'm neither a minority or poor. I did graduate twice with a 4.0 GPA. It wasn't easy, but I did it on my own.

I can't tell you how disappointed I am in these books. This series had potential but just didn't hold up. There were way too many similar situations. Every time you turn around there was a stalker who is trying to kill (poison) Mariss to get Bassy. Sebastian is suppose to be a powerful, super rich, muscle bound hunk but the female stalker just waltzes into his apartments and trashes it, steals money from his accounts, bombs the children's home and tries to poison his girlfriend. Yet when she confronted him IN PERSON, multiple times, he just calmly let's her walk away....doesn't restrain her and doesn't call the cops, just lets her go on her merry way telling her not to come near him again. COME ON REALLY! And after all the drama you get a chopped of ending with zero epilogue. Sorry, I can't recommend this series and I'm scratching my head trying to figure out how it got so many 5 star reviews.",Really!,3,1/11/2016

While I will admit this story has a good HFN, the characters were relatively likable and were loyal to each other, and the plot lines were tied up nicely- the maturity level for Chance and Parker seemed a little on the immature side. Even though they were both past college age, with Chance having been in the Army, and Parker passing the bar and even practicing law for a year before they both ended up actors- I felt I was reading a New Adult book by the dialogue and behavior I was reading. Both young men sounded very young, and hot-headed by the end of this book. Even the guys in the cover pic look very young to me- boys, not men. Sorry.",Nice story- but not for me.........,2,7/22/2016
